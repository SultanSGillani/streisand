A private BitTorrent tracker backend written in python, django, and redis

## To get started

- Install docker and docker-compose
  ([ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/),
  [mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/),
  [compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
- Run `./jc.sh build` to build the images
- Run `./jc.sh i setup-db` to create the db tables and load in some development data
- Run `./jc.sh m passwd admin` to set yourself a password for the admin
  user

The `docker-compose` builds all the containers and sets up the database with our core fixtures.
This may take a while, but afterwards subsequent commands will be much faster

## Managing

There are two ways of running common commands. The `jc.sh` script is responsible for things to do
with docker (running, building images) and `invoke` (sort of like Make, for python) is used within
the server to run commands. Django `manage.py` is also useful. Both invoke and manage.py are
accessible from the `jc.sh` script.

To list `jc.sh` commands:

    ./jc.sh

To list invoke commands:

    ./jc.sh i -l
    ./jc.sh i test

To list manage.py commands:

    ./jc.sh m
    ./jc.sh m passwd admin

 ## TODO: make windows.bat file.

### Running the dev server

    ./jc.sh runserver

You can find the api/django-admin server on <localhost:8000>, the frontend server on
<localhost:8001> and the tracker server on <localhost:7070>.

For example, here is an announce request that will work with the fixture data that was loaded in
by the `setup-db` command: <http://localhost:7070/16fd2706-8baf-433b-82eb-8c7fada847da/announce?info_hash=%89I%85%F9%7C%C2%5C%24n7%A0%7C%D7%C7%85%999%82%A7%CB&peer_id=-UT3400-111122221111&uploaded=721&downloaded=982&left=0&port=1337&ip=192.168.1.4>

### Rebuilding containers

If you change 

a) The python requirements file in backend

b) Any frontend files not in frontend/src/ including the javascript requirements file

you need to rebuild your local containers
by running:

    ./jc.sh build

There is no need to do this if you just change the source code for either the frontend or backend
(they are on docker volumes and changes should be loaded immediately)


## Windows

Install Docker for Windows and set it up to use linux containers. You will probably have to [share
the drive](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#shared-drives) where you have the git
repository.

From then on you can follow the instructions using your favourite command prompt.

Note that if you are using windows, due to the way the docker volume mounter handles file
permissions, you will have to type

    docker-compose run api python src/manage.py

instead of

    docker-compose run api src/manage.py

in the following instructions.

## Windows Instructions with No Docker 

To start you need to install the following:

 - Python 3.6.5: <https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5-amd64.exe>
 
    make sure you edit your environment variables so you can call python, and pip.
    
I recommend using Windows PowerShell for most commands.

 - Install Chocolatey for quick postgres install <https://chocolatey.org/>
 
 Install Postgresql: `choco install postgresql`
 
 Install Redis for windows: <https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases>
 
 You should then have postgresql installed. Make sure you set the postgresql database to the new .env file you have.
 Password, DB, etc.
 
 - Virtual Env  `pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win`
 
 Now you can create a new virtual environment with the mkvirtualenv command. As this command runs you'll see the environment being set up (what you see is slightly platform specific). When the command completes the new virtual enviroment will be active â€” you can see this because the start of the prompt will be the name of the environment in brackets (as shown below).

    `mkvirtualenv my_django_environment` 
    `From now on in this README (and indeed the module) please assume that any commands are run within a Python virtual environment like the one we set up above.`
    
 - Install Requirements:
 
  Now install the requirements, I have added a new folder at the root of the project.
    
    `cd backend`
    `pip3 install -r windows_requirements.txt`
    
 - Run the Development Server
 
  cd into the src folder and run the following before running the server:
  
  * Make Migrations:
  
  `python manage.py makemigrations`
  
  * Migrate:
  
  `python manage.py migrate`
  
  * Fixtures:
  
  `python manage.py loaddata foundation`
  
  `python manage.py loaddata dev`
  
  * Collect static files
  
  `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
  
  * Server:
  
  `python manage.py runserver_plus 0.0.0.0:8000`
  
 - I have updated the index.html file for it to work locally for everyone. Before you run "Collectstatic",
    make sure and copy the index.html, and bundle files from the folder here:
    
    `/backend/src/gulpfiles`
    
  Copy them to the folder labelled: `static/frontend`.
  
You can overwrite these files in the directory locally.
  
 
## Useful Commands

- `./jc.sh i reset-db`

This command resets the db and loads the core fixtures to revert to a starting state.

Currently the admin user password it creates is hashed and salted using argon2. It is recommended 
that you use the function:

- `./jc.sh m passwd admin`

To enter a new password for testing.
