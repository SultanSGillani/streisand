    "body": "[size=3][b][u]Am I connectable?[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nYou can check with TC's [url=https://tehconnection.eu/user.php?action=connchecker]connection checker[/url] or with [url=https://canyouseeme.org/]CanYouSeeMe.org[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b][u]What does it mean to be connectable, and why do I want it?[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nBeing connectable means your ports are forwarded properly and your computer is able to initiate contact with others. If you are connectable, you can seed to or leech from anybody in the swarm - if you are not, you are restricted to those who are.\r\n\r\nIf you are not connectable, you should still be able to download because most good seeders are connectable. However, you will have difficulty seeding because you will only be able to seed to connectable leechers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b][u]I am not connectable, what do I do?[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nFor most people, there are three general things to do in order to become connectable. \r\n\r\nFirst, you must make sure your torrenting computer will always have the same IP with your router. To do this, either setup a static IP from your computer, or lease an IP to your computer from your router.\r\n\r\nSecond, you must configure your router and/or modem to properly forward the port on which your torrent client is running to your computer. Most router control panels are accessible via one of the following local IP addresses:\r\nhttps://192.168.1.1\r\nhttps://192.168.1.254\r\nhttps://192.168.0.1\r\nhttps://10.0.0.1\r\n\r\nIf your internet connection looks like this:\r\nInternet -> Modem/Router -> Your computer\r\nYou need to tell your modem/router to forward your torrent port (check your client's settings to find/set this) to your computer's local IP.\r\n\r\nIf you internet connection looks like this:\r\nInternet -> Modem/Router -> Router -> Your computer\r\nYou need to tell your modem/router to forward your torrent port to your router's local IP, and then tell your router to forward your torrent port to your computer's local IP.\r\n\r\nThird, make sure any firewall running on your torrenting computer is allowing the port through.\r\n\r\nhttps://portforward.com has specific guides for most if not all of these steps, and even specific guides for most routers/modems.\r\n\r\n[i](More detail/specifics will be added later. If you feel like writing, go ahead.)[/i]",

We strongly recommend [url=https://xchat.org/]XChat[/url] for Linux.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Installing XChat[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nIf you're using Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Linux Mint, or any other Debian based flavour, use this command to install:\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre]sudo aptitude install xchat[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nIf you're on Arch Linux, you'll have to type in this:\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre]sudo pacman -Sy xchat[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nFedora Core / CentOS works a bit different:\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre]sudo yum install xchat[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nAnd finally, Gentoo works like this:\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre]sudo emerge xchat[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Configuring XChat[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nNow that X-Chat is installed open it by typing [b]xchat[/b] in your terminal or [b]xchat2[/b], depending on your version.\r\n\r\nClick XChat -> Network List (or press Ctrl-S). This should open up a new window with several (irrelevant) servers and some text boxes.\r\n\r\nStart by filling in these:\r\n\r\n[b]Nick Name:[/b] The nick you'd like to go by in #TehConnection, your site nick is recommended.\r\n[b]Second Choice:[/b] Alternate nick if your preferred choice is taken.\r\n[b]Third Choice:[/b] Third alternate, just in case.\r\n[b]User Name:[/b] Your TehConnection username\r\n[b]Real Name:[/b] This shows up when someone uses the /whois command on you, so either put something witty here or your TehConnection username as well.\r\n\r\nYour window should now look like:\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i42.tinypic.com/69qiwy.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nNow, click [b]Add[/b] and it will give you a new entry, name it \"TehConnection\" and click edit. This will bring up another menu, modify it to look like this:\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i43.tinypic.com/5ujln5.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nNow, click close, then connect. You will now connect to our server!\r\n\r\nIf you want to join our main channel, you'll need to register your nick. Wait a few minutes to allow nickserv to settle. It does not like brand new users sometimes. Now perform this command:\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre]/msg NICKSERV REGISTER PASSWORD EMAIL[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nReplace PASSWORD & EMAIL with your details. The e-mail is irrelevant, enter anything there. The password is very important to remember though, so be careful.\r\n\r\nYou should now be logged in under your nick, so head over to the main channel by typing this where [b]SITE NICK[/b] is your TehConnection site nick and [b]IRC KEY[/b] is the key set in your profile (Click 'Edit' up above, where your stats are):\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre]/msg Zooey AUTH SITE NICK IRC KEY\r\n\r\n/join #TehConnection[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nThe next time you join the server, you'll need to login by using this command, you can add this command to the \"Connect command\" field to make it automatic:\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre]/msg NICKSERV IDENTIFY PASSWORD[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nIf you scroll up to the images there is a nickserv field, you can put your password there and your client will automatically identify you and join you to the channel if it's in the \"Favourite channels\" field.\r\n\r\nYou can also specify multiple channels to join by adding to the [b]Favourite channels[/b] field. It follows the form #channel1,#channel2,channel3 etc...\r\n\r\nFor detailed IRC Network Information and channels available see [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=104]here[/url].\r\n\r\n[i]Many thanks to mephistopheles for this guide.\r\nDiscuss and ask for help [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=267]here[/url].",

    "body": "Some of you may find this laughable, but we all know that not everyone is at the same level, and we all started at the beginning. I threw this guide together to help out some of our newer users, and maybe boost the \"Everyone upload one movie\" idea. So let's get started:\r\n\r\n1. Before we do anything with uTorrent, we need to find our personal announce url. To do this, Click the Upload link on the user toolbar. Your personal announce url is in the yellow box.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i44.tinypic.com/ip772o.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nCopy it to a text file. Now we're ready to make the torrent:\r\n\r\n2. Open up uTorrent. Click File->Create Torrent.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i41.tinypic.com/2s8l2it.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n3. Click Add Directory, and browse to the folder that contains the movie you want to upload.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i41.tinypic.com/5l8eox.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n4. Paste your personal announce url in the Trackers box.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i41.tinypic.com/2mywwsp.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n5. Tick the Initial Seed and Private checkboxes. Initial Seed means that uTorrent will start seeding the torrent as soon as you're done, and you won't have to load it manually. (You also don't have to redownload the .torrent file after you upload it to the site.) Private means that it will disable DHT and Peer Exchange, which aren't allowed on Private Trackers as it makes it harder to track ratio, as well as possible to share to unregistered users. You can also add a comment at this point if you like. Something along the lines of \"Upped by (yournamehere)\" or similar if you choose. This can be left blank. Leave skip files alone, as well as web seeds, and keep piece size at auto detect.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i39.tinypic.com/qyemmo.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n6. Click Create And Save As, then browse to your torrent file folder (where your actual .torrent files are stored that you've downloaded, or another location if you so choose.) In the new dialogue, your torrent name will default to the name of the directory. You should just leave it be.\r\n\r\n7. Upload your newly made .torrent file to TehConnection, and clap giddily at the beautiful new torrent description page you made.\r\n\r\n8. Right click the new torrent in uTorrent and click Update Tracker. This will let the tracker know that you've uploaded the torrent to the site and start adding users to the swarm.\r\n\r\n9. Seed til the internet dies!",

    "body": "[i]This article is a work in progress and I'd encourage all users to post in this [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=713]thread[/url] with things which have been forgotten or glossed over (there will be quite a few). Ideally we will all contribute and make this a comprehensive yet easy to understand guide.[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\nH.264 / MPEG-4 AVC is the new standard for video compression superceding MPEG-4 ASP (DivX/Xvid). All of the H.264 content you will find on TehConnection will be stored in the Matroska container due to current limitations with the .mp4 container. \r\n\r\nWhat is a Matroska (.mkv) file? If you're reading this you have most likely come across one or two during your trawls around TehConnection. Matroska is an modern open standard media container: think of it as an envelope which allows you to put different video and audio streams inside it (you can even add subtitle streams and chapters). You can learn more about Matroska and what it is able to do from [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska]Wikipedia[/url], [url=https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=54306]Doom9[/url] and the [url=https://www.matroska.org/]Matroska[/url] website.\r\n\r\nOther than computers (Windows, Mac or Linux) there isn't a lot of standalone hardware support for the Matroska standard yet. We have tutorials on converting and playing these files for other pieces of hardware such as Apple TV (tutorial coming...), Playstation 3 ([url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=90]Ubuntu[/url], [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=94]Windows[/url]) and Xbox360 ([url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=1236]Windows[/url]).\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in standalone support you can start by looking at the [url=https://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=572]WDTV[/url] ([url=https://wdtvforum.com/main/]forum[/url]), [url=https://www.popcornhour.com/onlinestore/]Popcorn Hour[/url] ([url=https://www.networkedmediatank.com/index.php]forum[/url]) and the [url=https://netgear.com/Products/Entertainment/DigitalMediaPlayers/EVA9150.aspx]Netgear EVA9150[/url]. Of course building your own media PC is also an option ;-)\r\n\r\nThe more important concern, however, is how to play these files on your PC. There are a few methods, some better than others but I'd suggest finding which one which you find the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n[align=center]---------------------------+|||+---------------------------[/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5][u]Windows[/u][/size][/b]\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to gain Matroska playback in Windows. Use a media player which relies on DirectShow CODECs to be installed or install a media player with its own CODECs.\r\n\r\nIt is far better to choose the second option for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n - Programs which include their own CODECs will actually playback 99.99% of all media files in existence with no need  for any other sort of CODEC pack at all meaning the number of programs you need to have installed is greatly reduced.\r\n\r\n - Although this isn't so common anymore, installing multiple filters and CODECs can possibly cause conflict and break support for certain types of media playback.\r\n\r\nThe following media players are examples of payers which include their own CODECs.\r\n\r\n - [b][url=https://www.videolan.org/vlc/]VLC[/url][/b] - A Cross platform media player and streaming server.\r\n\r\n - [b][url=https://kmplayer.en.softonic.com/]KMPlayer[/url][/b] - A free multi-format media player.\r\n\r\nThe Haali Media Splitter is one of the best filters for Matroska file playback. This can be found [url=https://haali.cs.msu.ru/mkv/]here[/url]. Installing this will ensure best possible Matroska playback results. Take a look at echohead's excellent [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=871]guide to installing KMPlayer and Haali[/url].\r\n\r\nIf you really must use a DirectShow based player it is strongly suggested you use Media Player Classic Home Cinema ([url=https://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/]MPC-HC[/url]). There is also a 64 bit version of MPC-HC and when combined with the 64 bit version of Haali can greatly improve playback performance on 64 bit systems (guide coming...).\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble playing back high definition Matroska files because of your hardware then [url=https://www.coreavc.com/]CoreAVC[/url] could help. CoreAVC is an extremely efficient software H.264 decoder which has been known to allow slower machines to play H.264 video much more smoothly. The drawback with this software is that it is payware and doesn't produce as nice looking playback as Haali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5][u]Mac[/u][/size][/b]\r\n\r\nAs with most Mac software Matroska playback is fairly easy to enable. There are three main ways to play Matroska files on your Mac:\r\n\r\n[b][url=https://www.videolan.org/vlc/]VLC[/url][/b] - A Cross platform media player and streaming server.\r\n\r\n[b][url=https://mplayerosx.sttz.ch/]MPLayerOSX[/url][/b] - The Movie Player. This is an excellent media player because it supports multi-threaded decoding (FFmpeg-MT, as of Rev. 8).\r\n\r\n[b][url=https://perian.org/]Perian[/url][/b] - A plugin for QuickTime which supports many popular video formats.\r\n\r\n[b][url=https://code.google.com/p/movist/]Movist[/url][/b] - Movie Player for Mac OS X based on QuickTime & FFmpeg. Extremely lightweight and fast scrubbing. Freeware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5][u]Linux[/u][/size][/b]\r\n\r\nEnabling Matroska support for Linux is fairly easy too.\r\n\r\n[b][url=https://www.videolan.org/vlc/]VLC[/url][/b] - A Cross platform media player and streaming server.\r\n\r\nFfmpeg (Coming Soon...)\r\n\r\nGstreamer (Coming soon...)",

    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]The 'Movie of the Week'[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nEvery week here at TehConnection, a movie is picked as Movie of the Week (MotW). \r\n\r\nWe use the MotW as a way to showcase what we believe is great cinema. We realise that everyone has different tastes and what is considered great by one person is not necessarily so to another. As such, we make an effort to vary our choices and have a [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=967]forum thread[/url] dedicated to taking suggestions from everybody. For more information on how the MotW is chosen see [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=153]this article[/url].\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, the MotW is freeleech for the entire week! This means you can download and watch the film with no penalty if you haven't heard about it before or are unsure if it is worth your time.\r\n\r\nStaff change the MotW weekly, usually around 1200 GMT Sunday. There is deliberately no absolute set time for this change.\r\n\r\nA Montage which includes all past MotW can be found [url=https://tehconnection.eu/montage.php?id=11]here[/url] and a discussion board for all past the MotW is [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewforum&forumid=30]here[/url].",

    "title": "Release Groups",
    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Scene and p2p Release Groups[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAll encodes are [b]NOT[/b] created equal. Some are so close to the source that you physically cannot see the difference between the two (this is known as \"transparent\" encoding) and some are so bad you might be better off watching a VHS tape. The rest are somewhere in the middle. TC [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=94]believes[/url] that quality is important, so we aim to archive the very best encodes, made from the best available sources.\r\n\r\nThere are many groups of people who encode films and release them to the file-sharing world (often known as \"encoding groups\" or \"release groups\"), and they all have different motivations and priorities. A group's name is normally denoted at the end of the file or folder for any particular release after the hyphen. For example, head over to our [url=https://jumpcut.to/something11770]Inception film page[/url] and open one of the 720p torrent descriptions. Depending on which one you opened you notice that the release group responsible for the torrents is either 'CROSSBOW' or 'ESiR'.\r\n\r\nGroups that are part of the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez_scene]Scene[/url] follow a basic set of rules, but their goal is to release an encode before any other group which often means quality consideration is less than it could be. Peer to peer (p2p) groups are any groups not part of the Scene. They are commonly found on private trackers but can also release to public trackers, forums, DDL boards or even to FTP sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]How to Tell What's What[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nIf you aren't sure whether the release you have is Scene or p2p, a fast method of finding out is to search for the release in a public [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre_channel#Pre_database]pre database[/url]. If the release is in the database it is Scene, if not then chances are it is p2p.\r\n\r\nThere is no complete database of every Scene release ever released but many of the public ones come fairly close with several million records being available. Some of the better pre databases online include [url=https://pre.corrupt-net.org/]Corrupt-Net[/url], [url=https://predb.me/]PreDB.me[/url], [url=https://www.orlydb.com/]orlydb[/url], and [url=https://www.srrdb.com/]srrdb[/url].\r\n\r\nIn addition to these databases, TC maintains an up-to-date(ish) [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=147]list of Scene groups that release films[/url].\r\n\r\np2p releases can come from anyone not part of the Scene and therefore not subject to their rules, so there is a lot of variance in encode quality. Every encode should be judged on its own merit; however, in the course of moderating TC's large selection of torrents, we have observed some trends. You may find this [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=148]commented list of p2p groups[/url] to be useful in your search for quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Fake Groups[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\nSometimes encoders will tag their releases with fake group names.\r\n\r\n[b]Example[/b]: The.Number.23.UNRATED.DVDRip.XviD-NUMBER23\r\n\r\nThese group names are usually part of the movie name itself, and change from release to release. If you find one of these, you will obviously not recognize the group name, so you should look for it on a predb to determine if it is a Scene release or not. If you are still lost, send a [url=https://tehconnection.eu/staffpm.php?action=new]Staff PM[/url].",

The size given must be a number from 0 to 7:\r\n\r\n[size=0]This text is size 0 (tiny).[/size]\r\n[size=1]This text is size 1 (very small).[/size]\r\n[size=2]This text is size 2 (small).[/size]\r\n[size=3]This text is size 3 (normal).[/size]\r\n[size=4]This text is size 4 (large).[/size]\r\n[size=5]This text is size 5 (very large).[/size]\r\n[size=6]This text is size 6 (huge).[/size]\r\n[size=7]This text is size 7 (ridiculous).[/size]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]color=n]...[[i][/i]/color][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]color] tag allows you to control the text color. You can specify the color as either a three-digit hex code, like #069, or as a six-digit hex code, like #E34715, or as a standard HTML color name, like red. For example, [[i][/i]color=red]Red[[i][/i]/color] will appear as [color=red]Red[/color], and [[i][/i]color=#069]True blue![[i][/i]/color] will appear as [color=#069]True blue![/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]font=n]...[[i][/i]/font][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]font] tag allows you to alter the text's typeface. You may use specific font names, like Times New Roman, or generic font names, like cursive. Note that if you want to use a name that contains spaces, like Times New Roman, you should surround it in quotation marks, like this: [[i][/i]font=\"Times New Roman\"]...[[i][/i]/font].\r\n\r\nNote that the [[i][/i]font] tag allows you to separate font names with commas, just like CSS does, so that if a given font is not available, your choice of fallback fonts can be used instead: [[i][/i]font=Arial,Helv,Helvetica,sans]...[[i][/i]/font]\r\n\r\nThe [[i][/i]font] tag also recognizes the five standard CSS \"generic\" font names:\r\n[list=circle]\r\n    [*] serif - A serifed font, like Times or Roman\r\n    [*] sans-serif - A sans-serif font, like Helvetica or Arial (also sansserif, sans serif, and just sans)\r\n    [*] cursive - A cursive font, like Zapf-Chancery\r\n    [*] fantasy - A \"fantasy\" font, like Western\r\n    [*] monospace - A fixed-width font, like Courier (also mono) \r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Links[/b] (url)[/size]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]url=n]...[[i][/i]/url][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]url] tag allows you to insert links to external documents.

You should provide a URL to the image between the start and end [[i][/i]img] tags. The URL must end with .jpg, .png or .gif; for example:\r\n\r\n[[i][/i]img]https://static.tehconnection.eu/styles/hadronic/images/logo_small.png[[i][/i]/img] would give:\r\n\r\n[img]https://static.tehconnection.eu/styles/hadronic/images/logo_small.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Alignment[/b] (left, right, center, indent)[/size]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]center]...[[i][/i]/center][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]center] tag causes its contents to be broken into a separate block and aligned horizontally to the center of the page:\r\n[center]Centered text![/center]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]left]...[[i][/i]/left][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]left] tag causes its contents to be broken into a separate block and aligned horizontally to the left of the page:\r\n\r\n[left]Left-aligned text![/left]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]right]...[[i][/i]/right][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]right] tag causes its contents to be broken into a separate block and aligned horizontally to the right of the page:\r\n\r\n[right]Right-aligned text![/right]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]indent]...[[i][/i]/indent][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]indent] tag causes its contents to be broken into a separate block and be to indented, to have an approximately half-inch margin on the left side:\r\n\r\n[indent]Indented text![/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Tables[/b] (table, tr, td)[/size]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]table]...[[i][/i]tr]...[[i][/i]td]...[[i][/i]/td]...[[i][/i]/tr]...[[i][/i]/table][/color]\r\nTables will adjust their width based upon the text entered.\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n[[i][/i]table]\r\n[[i][/i]tr]\r\n[[i][/i]td]This text appears in the first cell on the first line.[[i][/i]/td]\r\n[[i][/i]td]This text appears in the second cell on the first line.[[i][/i]/td]\r\n[[i][/i]/tr]\r\n[[i][/i]tr]\r\n[[i][/i]td]This text appears in the first cell on the second line.[[i][/i]/td]\r\n[[i][/i]/tr]\r\n[[i][/i]/table]\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n[table]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]This text appears in the first cell on the first line.[/td]\r\n[td]This text appears in the second cell on the first line.[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]This text appears in the first cell on the second line.[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/table]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Containers[/b] (code, quote, pre)[/size]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]code]...[[i][/i]/code][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]code] tag is designed for representing content from various programming languages without requiring use of special formatting to display it. Every character between [[i][/i]code] and [[i][/i]/code] will be copied directly to the output, with whitespace including newlines and tabs, retained and preformatted. The only exception to this is that the first newline after the [[i][/i]code] tag will be removed, and the last newline before [[i][/i]/code] will be removed, just to keep the output from having wasted blank lines in it.\r\n\r\n[code]\r\ndef foo():\r\n    print(\"Here's some code!\")\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]quote]...[[i][/i]/quote]\r\n[[i][/i]quote=John]...[[i][/i]/quote][/color]\r\nThe quote tag is fairly self explanatory but it has been flashed up to give us the ability to add links. Clicking the 'quote' button on an forum post will quote a user like this [[i][/i]quote=sitenick]contents of quoted post[[i][/i]/quote] which gives us:\r\n\r\n[quote=sitenick]contents of quoted post[/quote]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]pre]...[[i][/i]/pre][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]pre] tag is designed to display preformatted text on a web page. This tag will display text in a fixed width font and preserve any spaces and line breaks which otherwise might be stripped out by our forums.\r\n\r\n[pre]Hello,  I  am  a  sentence  constructed  entirely  from  preformatted  text.\r\n   Look,\r\n      I\r\n         see\r\n            a\r\n               boat![/pre]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Lists[/b] (list)[/size]\r\n\r\n[color=red][[i][/i]list]...[[i][/i]*]...[[i][/i]*]...[[i][/i]/list]\r\n[[i][/i]list=type]...[[i][/i]*]...[[i][/i]*]...[[i][/i]/list][/color]\r\nThe [[i][/i]list] tag is designed for creating lists of things. In its default form, where no type is given, it creates a simple bullet-point list, like this:\r\n\r\n[table]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]\r\n[[i][/i]list]\r\n[[i][/i]*]John\r\n[[i][/i]*]Mary\r\n[[i][/i]*]Bill \r\n[[i][/i]*]Sue \r\n[[i][/i]/list]\r\n[/td]\r\n[td]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]John\r\n[*]Mary\r\n[*]Bill \r\n[*]Sue \r\n[/list]\r\n[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/table]\r\n\r\nNotice that while you do need to have an ending [[i][/i]/list] tag, you don't need to have an ending [[i][/i]/*] tag for each [[i][/i]*] tag; this makes creating lists somewhat simpler.\r\n\r\nYou can also create numbered lists by specifying what type of list you want; for example, if you want a numbered list, use type \"1\", or for an alphabetic list, use type \"A\", or for Roman numerals, use type \"i\". All possible list types are listed below:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] For an ordered list using Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3...) use [[i][/i]list=1]...[[i][/i]/list]\r\n[*] For an ordered list using Arabic numerals with a leading zero (01, 02, 03...) use [[i][/i]list=01]...[[i][/i]/list]\r\n[*] For an ordered list using capital letters (A, B, C...) use [[i][/i]list=A]...[[i][/i]/list]\r\n[*] For an ordered list using lower case letters (a, b, c...) use [[i][/i]list=a]...[[i][/i]/list]\r\n[*] For an ordered list using capital Roman numerals (I, II, III...) use [[i][/i]list=I]...[[i][/i]/list]\r\n[*] For an ordered list using lower case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii...) use [[i][/i]list=i]...[[i][/i]/list]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes your lesson with BBCode and TehConnection; go forth and make your text sexy!",

    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]DVDFab Platinum[/b][/size][/color] ([url=https://www.dvdfab.com/]https://www.dvdfab.com/[/url])\r\n\r\nThis is a simple program to use. Although it has lots of options, it should not be used to do re-encoding to Xvid or x264, or even re-encoding to DVD5, but to rip the disc to an untouched DVD9 it's intuitive and removes almost all protections in the market.\r\n\r\nFirst, this is what it looks like when you open it:[br /]\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://img38.imageshack.us/img38/7987/1552009225322.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nIf DVD is not the default option, you should choose 'DVD to DVD' on the left hand menu and then 'Full Disc'.\r\n\r\nAfter that, choose to see the options (the green button on top right) and ensure they look like this:[br /]\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://img36.imageshack.us/img36/214/1552009225342.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nRemember to select all of the protection removal options. Next find out which region your DVD is; this is usually specified on the packaging. Change the \"To Remove RCE, specify the disc region's code\" option to the one needed for your disc. This is step is important to make sure the DVD will play in any region. If your DVD is R0 (all regions), leave the 'Any' option checked.\r\n\r\nThese are the only options you might need to change. After that, click OK and go back to the main interface. Now insert the DVD:[br /]\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://img38.imageshack.us/img38/7340/1552009230832.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nIt will do some checks to discover the DVD size, protections, and features available. When it finished that, you will see something like this:[br /]\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://img35.imageshack.us/img35/6307/1552009225738.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nBelow the 'Source' option you can choose the target folder for the rip. You can choose between two options:\r\n[list=circle]\r\n[*]Rip to a Folder; yellow icon on the right: If you choose the folder, the DVD will be ripped to: [folder path here]/FullDisc/DVD name (Volume Label) with the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folders inside.\r\n[*]Rip to an ISO image file; white option with a disc icon: this will create an image of the DVD so it can be burned right away.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nTehConnection encoders prefer Ripping to folder so it's easier to encode. If you wish to have your rip encoded, it's better to choose this option. Anyway, choose which one you prefer and continue.\r\n\r\nIf you can choose all the options, it's important to do this:\r\n[list=circle]\r\n[*] Copying: All [u]Enabled[/u]\r\n[*] Removing: All [u][b]Un[/b]-checked[/u]\r\n[*] Navigation: All [u][b]Un[/b]-checked[/u] (you might want to remove the FBI warnings, but in this case I suggest you to leave it un-checked, so the DVD is really untouched, and to prevent possible playback problems)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nLeave the volume label as it is.\r\n\r\nNow the most important step:\r\n\r\nChange the last option to [b]DVD9[/b] and see if [b]Quality: 100%[/b] is displayed.\r\n\r\nThis will make sure no re-encoding is done, and the DVD will remain untouched and identical as it is on the disc.\r\n\r\nReview all the options to make sure everything is right. After this, you are ready to begin the ripping process. Choose 'Start'.[br /]\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://img34.imageshack.us/img34/8334/1552009225911.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nWhen it ends (this usually doesn't take a long time, as it's almost just a copy and paste thing) click 'Finished' and close the program.\r\n\r\nYour untouched DVD rip is ready. Check if it's okay and play it with your player of choice. If possible, burn the rip before uploading to make sure it's 100% working.\r\n\r\nNow upload it to TehConnection and make everybody happy. We need more Untouched DVD-R's.",

    "title": "Backing up all torrent files used by uTorrent",
    "body": "Most of us have come across the situation where we must back up our data, switch over to another system, etc. Since we are all seeders here, we must have a practical way of backing up everything that's seeding. It's relatively simple.\r\n\r\n1. Locate your application data folder. If you are using Windows Xp, it should be located in C:\\Documents and Settings\\[b]%Username%[/b]\\Application Data. In Vista: C:\\Users\\%Username%\\AppData\\Roaming Or you could just type \"%AppData%\" in the address bar.\r\n[img]https://img88.imageshack.us/img88/1035/51184915qj7.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n2. Located in that folder should be all your torrents. uTorrent makes a read only copy of every torrent you load into it.\r\n[img]https://img257.imageshack.us/img257/5149/85898338sy6.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n3. Now just copy over the entire folder to a backup location, then when you reinstall uTorrent, over write the new folder with the backup.\r\n\r\nOf course this will only backup the \".torrents\" not the actual downloaded and seeded files.",

    "body": "BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) communications protocol. BitTorrent is a method of distributing large amounts of data widely without the original distributor incurring the entire costs of hardware, hosting, and bandwidth resources. Instead, when data is distributed using the BitTorrent protocol, each recipient supplies pieces of the data to newer recipients, reducing the cost and burden on any given individual source, providing redundancy against system problems, and reducing dependence on the original distributor.\r\n\r\nThe protocol is the brainchild of programmer Bram Cohen, who designed it in April 2001 and released a first implementation on 2 July 2001. It is now maintained by Cohen's company BitTorrent, Inc.\r\n\r\nUsage of the protocol accounts for significant traffic on the Internet, but the precise amount has proven difficult to measure.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous compatible BitTorrent clients, written in a variety of programming languages, and running on a variety of computing platforms.",

    "title": "BitTorrent: Becky's Beginner Guide",
    "body": "Hi guys! Sadly, the original and \"official\" Beginner's Guide to BitTorrent has been lost forever due to the tragedies of 10/23/07 (Unless someone had a backup lol?). Anyway, here's a replacement..I even remade some of my glorious stick figure drawings.\r\n\r\n[size=5]Becky's Beginner Guide to BitTorrent[/size][size=1]\r\n[i]*** I use uTorrent in my screenshots, which is the client I recommend, however, there are plenty of torrent clients around.\r\nI don't support the illegal downloading and uploaded of pirated materials. BitTorrent is perfectly legal, FYI.\r\n[b]This is a BEGINNER guide, aka read this if you have NO idea what BitTorrent is, or what it does. There are more technical guides out there, but this is for those who are not very tech savvy.[/i][/size]\r\n[u]\r\nTable of Contents\r\n[/u]\r\n1.What is BitTorrent?\r\n2.How does it work, exactly?\r\n3.What's a tracker?\r\n4.How do I download something?\r\n5.What are ratios, and why should I worry about them?\r\n6.What clients are available for me to use?\r\n7.Defining \"connectable\" or \"clever\" (SOLVES 90% OF UPLOAD ISSUES)\r\n8.End Notes\r\n[/b]\r\n\r\n[size=4]\r\n1.What is BitTorrent?[/size]\r\n\r\n        Let's look to our trusty Wikipedia and what it has to say on BitTorrent...\r\n\r\n        [i]\"BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) communications protocol. BitTorrent is a method of distributing large amounts of data widely without the original distributor incurring the entire costs of hardware, hosting and bandwidth resources.\"[/i]\r\n\r\n        Wow, that is a mouthful...let me try and paraphrase this in laymen's terms...\r\n\r\n        [i]\"BitTorrent is a type of P2P protocol which people can use to send and receive large files without putting too much pressure on a particular server.[/i]\r\n\r\n        Much easier, right? BitTorrent is a medium between people who want to share data with each other, whether it be music, a program, or the latest update on a game. It also saves space and bandwidth for site owners who don't want to put so much on their server. You use a BitTorrent client (program) which connects to a tracker (explained later), which then lets you connect to other people and get the data you need.\r\n[size=4]\r\n2. But how does it work, exactly?[/size]\r\n\r\n        BitTorrent really isn't that complicated once you see how it works, but we'll start out simple. First, we need to define a few terms.\r\n        If you have downloaded the ENTIRE torrent to your PC, or if you were the person originally uploaded it, then you are a seeder. If you are still downloading any part of it, you are a leecher. All of the leechers and seeders together make up the swarm.\r\n        Data is transferred from the seeders to the leechers, as shown here...\r\n\r\n[img=https://img48.imageshack.us/img48/7528/33926898ex8.png]\r\n\r\n        As you can see, the seeders are sending what they have to the leechers...they aren't sending anything to each other though, since they finished the torrent.\r\n        But wait, there's more! In order to make the downloading/uploading way more efficient and quicker, leechers also send data to each other to finish everything faster than just the seeders sending data.\r\n        Let's say for example, you're downloading an album, and so is Bob. Both you and Bob are getting data from seeders, but not at the same rate. Bob gets Song 5, but doesn't have Song 4. You have Song 4 but not Song 5...so you send it to each other! Everyone is working together to get the download done.\r\n\r\n[img=https://img155.imageshack.us/img155/4913/93231886pl0.png]\r\n\r\n        So yeah, not that complicated, right?\r\n[size=4]\r\n3. What's this tracker I keep hearing about?[/size]\r\n\r\n        Well, obviously people don't just randomly connect to each other computer wise, right? They need something to start the process. The tracker acts both as a \"door\" of sorts to other people and as a bouncer at the same time. In those pictures, you could almost think of that black line seperating the seeders and leechers as the tracker, in a way.\r\n        Trackers do more than help people connect, though. Many trackers nowadays are equipped with anti-cheating systems that kick people trying to fake downoading/uploading in a swarm \" - they also find and detect people who are trying to send bad (and possibly malicious) data to other people.\r\n        You see, in order to connect to a tracker you need a .torrent file. The .torrent file contains, in a way, exactly what should be on that torrent. If a peer tries to send bad or false data to the tracker or other peers, they get cut off.\r\n        So trackers are a good thing!\r\n\r\n        Q. But what data are they getting about me personally?\r\n        A. Well, a tracker should only be getting a few things, that being your IP and your upload/download stats*. Your peers will get the same thing \" - I know, it seems uncool to have your IP plastered all over a swarm, but in this case having people's IP is a good thing \" - if someone is trying to send bad data and the tracker isn't catching them, you can block the IP.\r\n        *The tracker collects certain data too, like what client your using, header files, etc...but trackerlog information is pretty meaningless unless you're an admin looking for cheaters, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.\r\n[size=4]\r\n4. Alright, so how do I download something?[/size]\r\n\r\n        I know I know, you're itching to get going, I'm sure. Well, let's crack open uTorrent here...once you've got a .torrent file on your PC, double click it, and you should get something like this...\r\n\r\n[img=https://img90.imageshack.us/img90/3091/40740752go6.png]\r\n\r\n        The button with the three dots (...) lets you choose where you want the downloaded file to go. Specify a location, check or uncheck what you want in the box below, and hit OK. It should start downloading right away unless something is up with the tracker..\r\n\r\n[img=https://img137.imageshack.us/img137/914/92520209wh3.png]\r\n\r\n        That's it. Make sure to keep your torrent running once it's finished! If you have to ask why, read on to the next section...\r\n[size=4]\r\n5. What are ratios, and why do I care?[/size]\r\n\r\n        Remember, BitTorrent only works because there are seeders to send the data around. If everyone simply leeched and left (a \"hit and run\", as they say), there wouldn't be any seeders...and eventually, the torrent would die! Now we don't want that, do we?\r\n        Your ratio is the amount of data you've uploaded divided by the amount downloaded. So if you upload the exact amount you download, you have a ratio of 1.0...if you don't want to seed something forever, at least getting your ratio to 1.0 is a nice goal. That way you've gotten the chance to share something.\r\n        But, if you upload LESS than what you take, then you have a bad ratio...and in some torrent sites, the site records your ratio \" - in many cases, if you have a really poor ratio, you're kicked off the site!\r\n\r\n        [size=3]Remember: Sharing is caring![/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4]\r\n6. What clients can I use for BitTorrent?[/size]\r\n\r\n        There are dozens and dozens, but in terms of Windows, my first and only choice is uTorrent. It is light on resources, easy to install, and easy to navigate. https://www.utorrent.com/\r\n        *I do not like the person that bought uTorrent over this past year, so I have stopped upgrading once the new owner came into place. I use, and recommend, the 1.6 builds.\r\n\r\n        As for Macs, I definitely recommend Azureus. Although it can be a bit heavy since it's using Java, it's certainly one of the most stable of clients for Mac PCs. https://azureus.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\n        Before you choose a client, do your research! Some websites BAN certain clients, and you can get your account killed for using a banned client! But most of, if not all sites , will allow uTorrent or Azureus, so your best bet is probably with one of those.\r\n[size=4]\r\n7. What is \"connectable\" or \"clever\", and why do I need to be...?[/size]\r\n\r\n        Okay, so you may have noticed that you aren't connecting to many people...or that you belong to a site where they list you as unconnectable or \"Not clever\". But what does this mean?\r\n        Let's pretend you and your friend are on two sides of a door. Your friend has a key, but you don't. You might be able to open the door, but it would require a lot of banging and attention to get your friend to know to do so.\r\n        Now, let's say neither of you have a key. How can you open the door? Exactly, you can't.\r\n        Basically, when you aren't connectable, you are unable to receive requests to connect to peers. You can send out some, and hope that connectable people there accept it. But if no one in the swarm is connectable...how are\r\n\r\n        Take a look at www.portforward.com and it's hundreds of tutorials on how to get your PC or router set up correctly if you need to.\r\n[size=4]\r\n8. End Notes\r\n[/size]\r\n        That's about it. Those that remember the original tutorial know this is lacking in a bit, but hey, what can yah do?\r\n\r\n        Anyway, feel free to ask me whatever, here or via PM...if not me, there's always other people around to help. Just try not to ask a question that's plainly answered in the tutorial, please? That just shows you didn't actually take the time to read it, which is not cool.\r\n\r\n        [i]Yours Truly,\r\n        Becky[/i]\r\n\r\nWell, there we go. Sad. I miss my original. I might get around to making my Port Forwarding guide again sometime, and my other tutorials, but we'll see.\r\n\r\nTutorial made by [url=https://what.cd/user.php?id=4074]Becky[/url]",

    "title": "Definitions of commonly misunderstood terms",
    "body": "[b]Seeding[/b]: Many people confuse this term with the term uploading.  Seeding means that you are letting the tracker know that you can begin uploading data whereas uploading refers to transferring data to other people in the swarm.  You get nothing for seeding alone but you get upload credit for uploading.  It is important to make this distinction when asking for help because they are two entirely different things.\r\n\r\n[b]Snatch[/b]: This term is often confused with leeching as in the sentence, \"I'm snatching a torrent.\" In reality a snatch refers to completing the download.  So it is proper to say \"This torrent has 20 snatches\" but it is not proper to say \"There are 20 people snatching this torrent.\"\r\n\r\n[b]Peers[/b]: This is a term that is commonly misused throughout the BitTorrent community.  In many clients peers is misused to refer to what are actually leechers.  The term actually refers to both the seeders and the leechers. \r\n  \r\n[b]Passkey/password/IRC key[/b]:  Your passkey is something that is embedded in the torrent files you download and upload to ensure that you get credited accordingly.  Your password is what you use to login to the site or authenticate with nickserv on IRC.  The passwords for IRC and the site do not have to be the same nor must they be different.  Your IRC key is something you set in your profile so that you can join members only channels like #TehConnection.\r\n\r\n[b]Connectable[/b]: It is often thought that if you are not connectable you can't upload to anybody or you can't seed.  However, connectable actually doesn't mean that at all.  If you aren't connectable the only thing you can't do is connect to other people that are also not connectable.  You will still be able to connect to people that are connectable.",

    "title": "Distributed Hash Table (DHT): Disable in Azureus & uTorrent",
    "body": "DHT - Distributed hash table\r\n\r\nDistributed hash tables (DHTs) are a class of decentralized distributed systems that provide a lookup service similar to a hash table: (name, value) pairs are stored in the DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given name. Responsibility for maintaining the mapping from names to values is distributed among the nodes, in such a way that a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption. This allows DHTs to scale to extremely large numbers of nodes and to handle continual node arrivals, departures, and failures.\r\n\r\nDHTs form an infrastructure that can be used to build more complex services, such as distributed file systems, peer-to-peer file sharing and content distribution systems, cooperative web caching, multicast, anycast, domain name services, and instant messaging. Notable distributed networks that use DHTs include BitTorrent (with extensions), eDonkey network, YaCy, and the Coral Content Distribution Network.\r\n\r\n[u]Why is it important to disable DHT[/u]\r\n\r\nIf you have enabled DHT you could be uploading to people who don't even have access to the site so you won't be receiving the proper credit for your uploads & downloads. You will be sharing data out of the tracker and those ghost peers will be using your bandwidth to download from you.\r\nThat's why you are forced now to re-download your torrents from the site if you didn't create the torrent file properly.\r\nBut there is another problem with DHT, it opens way too many connections to your computer and it could cause many problems ... for example your router could run out of memory and freeze often, or your connection becomes very slow.\r\nOne of the first processes that fails is DNS relay, which is why existing connections  continue to work but new connections, like web browsing, starts failing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]In Azureus:[/b]\r\n\r\n1. Tools/Options/Connection (Tab)/ under \"Peer Sources - Select the default permitted sources for peer connections\" only check \"From a tracker\" and [b]uncheck[/b]:  \r\n- Decentralized tracking     \r\n- Supplied by another peer\r\n- Added by a plugin\r\n\r\n2. Tools/Options/Plugins/Distributed DB/ [b]uncheck[/b]: - Enable the distributed database\r\n\r\n3. Tools/Options/Plugins/Distributed Tracker/[b]uncheck[/b]: -Only track normal torrents when their tracker is unavailable\r\n4. Tools/Options/Tracker/Sharing/[b]check[/b]: - Private torrent - only accept torrents from the tracker \r\n(This should automatically grey out the option bellow: \"Allow decentralized tracker when tracker is unavailable\")\r\n\r\nClick on the Save button and restart Azureus.\r\nYou should see a red dot and \"Disabled\" on the bottom of the main Azureus window.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]In uTorrent:[/b]\r\nOptions/Preferences/BitTorrent/ [b]uncheck[/b]:  \r\n- Enable DHT Network \r\n- Enable DHT for new torrents\r\n\r\nClick OK to save changes.\r\nYou should see \"DHT: Disabled\" on the bottom of the main uTorrent window.",

This means that you may have three ([b]3[/b]) different computers connected to the tracker at any one time. Any more than three ([b]3[/b]) connections at once will result in a warning, or worse.\r\n\r\nThe tracker will not be confused and will track statistics correctly.

Each torrent file you download is auto-generated to be unique to this passkey. When you download a torrent file, you are not downloading the same torrent file as another user downloads - each torrent file is auto-generated for each user. No matter what IP Address you connect from, the tracker will recognize your account based on your unique passkey instead of your IP address.\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][i]Note: sharing your torrent files among friends is forbidden for this reason.

    "body": "[size=4][b]Help! My ports are blocked![/b][/size]\r\nYou've probably arrived at this guide to help solve that problem. The goal is to fix your blocked ports and rid your torrent client of its \"NAT Errors\".\r\n\r\nThis page, for the most part, will assume that you're connected to the internet like this:\r\n[pre]Cable/DSL modem -> Router -> Computer[/pre]\r\nIt is irrelevant whether or not your computer is connected wirelessly, or if your router and modem are one unit.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]But what's a NAT Error?[/b][/size]\r\nA NAT Error means that other computers on the internet are unable to connect to yours. This is normal, because most routers block all incoming connections by default.\r\n\r\nYour router has an [b]external[/b] IP address. You can see it at [url=https://www.whatismyip.org/][u]WhatIsMyIP[/u][/url] or [url=https://www.ipchicken.com/][u]IPChicken[/u][/url]. Your router assigns your computer an [b]internal[/b], or [b]local[/b], IP address. This internal IP address will be in one of the following formats:\r\n[pre]192.168.X.X\r\n172.16.X.X\r\n10.X.X.X[/pre]\r\nThe idea is to set your router to take any incoming connections directed at it, and forward them to your internal IP address.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]How do I forward my port?[/b][/size]\r\nPortForward.com hosts many [url=https://www.portforward.com/routers.htm][u]excellent guides[/u][/url]. Find your router on the list and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n[b]What ports do I forward?[/b]\r\nLook for a \"Listening port\" or something similar in your torrent client's settings. You should not have it set from 6881-6889, because many ISPs throttle or block traffic on those ports. It is good to just choose a random port between 10000 and 65535.\r\n\r\n[b]What IP address do I put in the port forwarding settings?[/b]\r\nYou put your [i]internal[/i] IP address into your router's port forwarding settings. Here is how you find your internal IP address:\r\nIn [b]Windows[/b], go to:\r\nStart -> Run -> [b]cmd[/b] -> (Press Enter or click OK) -> [b]ipconfig[/b] -> (Press Enter); It will be listed as [b]IP Address[/b]\r\n\r\nIn [b]Mac OS X[/b], go to:\r\nSystem Preferences -> Network -> (select the network connection with the Green dot) -> Configure\r\n\r\n[b]Do I choose TCP or UDP?[/b]\r\nYou will be presented with the option to forward your port on TCP or UDP, or both. You definitely do want to forward TCP, because that's what all torrent traffic travels over. UDP is optional, and [u]does not affect torrents on private sites such as this one[/u]. UDP is used for your client's DHT service that allows you to find more peers on public torrents. Forward UDP as well if you use DHT and public torrents a lot.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]What's this about a static IP address?[/b][/size]\r\nIf your port forwarding guide mentioned that you should have a static IP address, then read this.\r\nYour router automatically assigns your computer an internal IP address, like 192.168.1.101. But sometimes it will assign your computer a different IP address, such as 192.168.1.102. This often occurs because another computer connected to the router has already taken .101. This presents a problem because, for example, if you have your listening port forwarded to .101 and your IP address changes, it will no longer be forwarded correctly and you will receive a NAT Error. It is recommended that you follow [url=https://www.portforward.com/networking/staticip.htm][u]this guide[/u][/url] in order to assign your computer a static internal IP address. In Windows, if you find that only one DNS server is listed, then leave the Alternate DNS Server box empty or throw in an [url=https://www.opendns.com][u]OpenDNS[/u][/url] address like 208.67.222.222 as backup.\r\n\r\nContrary to what the guide says, though, you should set your static IP address to a relatively high number, so that other computers on your network never have a chance of being assigned that number automatically (causing a conflict). For example, if your IP addresses are currently ending with .101 or .102, you should set yours to .244 or something, in order to avoid any conflict (.255 max).\r\n[b]A word of warning:[/b]\r\nWhen you set your static IP address, you had to specify the DNS servers. In the future, your ISP may change these addresses. So if you ever have connectivity problems, change back to a non-static IP address and see if your DNS servers need to be changed to new addresses.\r\n[b]Oh no it killed my internet[/b]\r\n99% of the time, when your internet connection stops responding after setting a static IP address, it means that there is a typographical error somewhere. You incorrectly typed in the IP address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, or DNS Server(s).\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Port Test[/b][/size]\r\nMake sure that a torrent is running, then use one of the following links to test whether your port is now open or not (replace 12345 with your listening port):\r\n[url]https://www.utorrent.com/testport.php?port=12345[/url]\r\n[url]https://www.grc.com/x/portprobe=12345[/url]\r\n[url]https://www.canyouseeme.org/[/url]\r\n[url]https://www.checkmyports.com/indexen.php?doscan=yes&port=12345[/url]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]My port isn't open. It said:[/b][/size]\r\n[b]Stealth/Blocked, with timeout/Connection timed out/Error!/Locked[/b]\r\nAre you sure that you clicked the Save Settings button after setting the port forwarding rules?\r\nAre you sure that you forwarded the correct port to the correct internal IP address?\r\nDoes your modem also have a built-in firewall that must be configured?\r\nAre you sure that you had a torrent running and listening on the port that you tested?\r\n[b]Closed/Actively Blocked/Error!/Locked[/b]\r\nAre you sure that you forwarded the correct port to the correct internal IP address?\r\nAre you running any software firewalls (such as Norton Internet Security, ZoneAlarm, or Sygate) that could be blocking incoming connections? Note that the free version of ZoneAlarm does not allow you to open your ports under any circumstances.",

    "title": "Port Forwarding: Becky's Beginner Guide",
    "body": "Prenote: This is not the exact copy of the tutorial I had on OiNK. I just rewrote it. In any case, this is a *beginner's* tutorial, which means the technical jargon is kept to a minimum - it's meant for the newbies :)\r\n\r\n[size=6]Beginner's Guide to Port Forwarding[/size]a\r\n\r\nSo you've just learned how BitTorrent works but then after all your hard research you download stuff, wait to upload, and what? Nothing's uploading? Chances are, if you are behind a router, you need to do some portfwarding. This is what happens when on the torrent pages, you are listed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[b]Not Connectable[/b]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\r\n[b]\r\n1.How Routers Work\r\n2.Internal vs External IPs\r\n3.Static vs Dynamic IPs\r\n4.How Ports Work\r\n5.Putting it All together\r\n6.Now What?[/b]\r\n[size=5]\r\nHow Routers Work[/size]\r\n\r\nBefore we can get into all that good junk, I think it's best to explain just how routers work.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have multiple PCs under one roof...rather than have a modem for every single PC to connect to the internet, you have one modem, and one router. With the router every PC in the house can connect to the internet, using a wireless connection. \r\n[size=5]\r\nInternal vs External IPs[/size]\r\n\r\nThe router has what's called an external IP address that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who you are. You, me, and everyone that's connected to the internet has an external IP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when you go to Google and do the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What's my IP?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that's your external.\r\n\r\nHowever, only one IP address is assigned for one household (unless you pay for it assuming your ISP offers...unlikely), so what happens when 3 different PCs are under one router? Well, they all have the same external address, but each individual PC has an internal IP address.\r\n\r\n[img=https://img182.imageshack.us/img182/5971/tut1pm1.png]\r\n\r\nThe internal IP address identifies each computer on the network. It's normally something like 192.xxx.x.xxx. For example, my internal IP address last time I checked was 192.168.1.160. Don't worry, nobody can see your internal address unless they're on the same network as you.\r\n[size=5]\r\nStatic vs Dynamic IPs[/size]\r\n\r\nDon't worry, we're getting to the good stuff soon. But you need to know this info in order to understand how port forwarding works. This is pretty easy though.\r\n\r\nA [i]dynamic[/i] IP address will change, most of the time randomly. This could apply to external or internal IPs, but for port forwarding you have to pay attention to the internal IP address. When does it change? It depends. Sometimes it'll change every time you reconnect, sometimes if you get rebooted...it just depends on the router.\r\n \r\nA [i]static[/i] IP address never changes; you set it to a specific IP and it stays there until the router is either set back to factory defaults or you change it. \r\n[size=5]\r\nHow Ports Work[/size]\r\n\r\nWhen a packet is sent to a computer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when information is sent to a computer that is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it travels through an open port. Your PC does this all the time without you even knowing! Common ports are used daily, for things like the internet, instant messaging, etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, it might be that your instant message client uses port 5555, and your IP is 987.654.321. When you are sending a message, the data is sent from 987.654.321:5555. The : designates the port number to be used.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of the ports on your connection are closed, unless you open them. This is all leading up to our next section...\r\n[size=5]\r\nBut what IS port forwarding? Why do I care? What does this have to do with my slow uploads!?[/size]\r\n\r\nWhen you don't have a port open for your BitTorrent client, it makes connecting to people extremely difficult. [b]When your ports are not forwarded, you can send a request to connect to a peer, but you can't receive any.[/b]\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nOk, let's say Bob, Sally, and Joe are all on a torrent. Bob is the only one that is connectable (ports forwarded). Sally sends a request to connect to Bob, which he can accept and they're fine. Joe does the same. However, Joe then sends a request to connect to Sally, but guess what? They aren't going to connect. Why? Because Sally can't receive any incoming connections.\r\n\r\nNow imagine if all three weren't connectable. [b]Nobody[/b] would connect! People would be sending requests left and right, but nothing.\r\n\r\nSo if you've noticed lately that you aren't connecting to any leechers (or seeders), and there are a LOT OF BOTH, then you need to do some port forwarding. Opening your ports will also greatly help your upload /download speed itself.\r\n[size=5]\r\nSo how do I do that?[/size]\r\n\r\nWell first you need to set up a static internal IP, what we were talking about earlier. Why is this? Because in order to forward your ports you have to assign a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in your router settings to keep that port open. You assign the rule based on the internal IP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that way the router knows which PC it's talking about.\r\n\r\nHave you seen the problem yet? If you have a dynamic static IP, every time your dynamic IP changes you have to go into your router settings and change it. Again. Sounds annoying, doesn't it? But if you make your IP static, all will be resolved :)\r\n\r\nA link to making your IP static can be found here (yes, for Macs too and even xbox 360): https://www.portforward.com/networking/staticip.htm\r\n\r\nThose directions are real easy, just follow them and you'll be good.\r\n\r\nOnce you've set up your static IP you need to pick a port to open up for your BT client. Assign this in your client settings, and then assign a rule in your router.\r\n\r\nDon't panic! I know that was no help. Portfoward.com has literally a guide for almost any router you can think of. Just go to https://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm , find your router, and then find your client in the list that pops up. 99% of the time those guides are very straight forward and simple.\r\n[size=5]\r\nOnce that's done...[/size]\r\n\r\nYou're done! Restart your client and you should be good! If you're not sure if it's working, go look at the peer list on one of the torrents you might be seeding/leeching \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it will have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd under connectable.\r\n[b]\r\nThe Most Common Reasons for the Port Forwarding Not Working:\r\n\r\n1.No static IP\r\n2.Typo in the router settings\r\n3.Typo in the client settings\r\n4.Firewall not given permission[/b]\r\n\r\nThat's right, I almost forgot to mention! Your [b]firewall[/b] software, if you run it, is very similar to what a router does. In fact I don't even use a firewall because my router does just fine. But if you do use one, you have to go to your firewall settings and give your torrent client permission to receive and send data/connections. \r\n\r\nThat's about it! If you have any questions feel free to PM me whenever, I'd be glad to help. Just please, be sure that you've actually read this first so you don't seem rather silly for asking me something that's clearly answered in the guide! Thanks for reading :)\r\n[i]\r\nYours Truly,\r\nBecky[/i]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAha, I rewrote another one. I still have like four other tutorials that were lost thanks to the raid. Here is number two. Only one stick figure like drawing this time, damn. I'm losing touch. If I can find the time I'll work on the other ones I will.\r\n\r\nTutorial made by Becky",

    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]How does the Request system work?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nTo create a request, you must be a [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=81]donor[/url] or in the 'Member' [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=2]user class[/url] or higher.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when you create a [url=https://tehconnection.eu/requests.php?action=new]request[/url], it takes two hundred fifty ([b]250[/b]) MB of upload credit to create it. When you make your request, two hundred fifty ([b]250[/b]) MB is deducted from your upload statistics. Whenever anyone creates or votes on a request, 50% of it is removed as a 'tax' by the system, to discourage people from dumping too much credit and screwing up ratios.\r\n\r\nAfter the request is made, the initial bounty is one hundred twenty-five ([b]125[/b]) MB. The other 125 - 50% of 250 MB - is taken out as a tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Custom Bounties[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nMembers can vote on any request, which costs two hundred fifty ([b]250[/b]) MB. one hundred twenty-five ([b]125[/b]) MB of this is subtracted as the tax, and the other one hundred twenty-five ([b]125[/b]) MB is added to the request total bounty.\r\n\r\nTo vote on a request easily you can click the small plus symbol next to each request in the 'Votes column. The number in that column simply denotes the number of votes each request has received.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Custom Bounties[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nYou also have the option of adding custom bounties in the request details page; click on the name of the film on the requests page.\r\n\r\nSay I have 1274 MB of upload credit I'm willing to give to a particular request. I click on the plus symbol on the requests page and my ratio is deducted two hundred fifty ([b]250[/b]) MB. At this point, because of the tax, the request now has an added one hundred twenty-five ([b]125[/b]) MB of bounty attached to it. I go ahead and click on the request name and add the other 1024 MB to it via the 'Custom Bounty' box. 50% of it is removed as a tax, so 512MB of it is taken and the other 512MB is added as bounty. At this point I would have 1274 MB deducted from my upload credit and the request would have an added bounty of 637 MB of bounty added to its total.\r\n\r\nNext to the 'Custom Bounty' box are two radio buttons denoting whether the request amount should be measured in MB or GB. Be careful with these as accidentally contributing 250 GB can be much more painful than accidentally contributing 250 MB.\r\n\r\nWhen the request is filled, everyone that has contributed ratio to the bounty is notified, whether the original requester or a voter.\r\n\r\nWhen someone fills a request you've made or voted on, no more credit is removed from your stats. The only time that happens is when you make or vote on a request.\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b] at no point is your download amount affected, only your upload stats, ever. Also, if you delete your request, you will not get the bounty back.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to remove a vote you have placed on another users request. There is a strict no refunds policy on requests.",

If you're looking for a client that's feature rich (i.e. not Transmission), but doesn't hog resources (i.e. not Azureus) I highly recommend rtorrent. It's a fairly easy install, but it differs depending on if you are running 10.5 or Tiger or lower.\r\n\r\n[size=4]Fink[/size]\r\n\r\nThe first step is to install Fink (macports is also able to install rtorrent, however, this will not be covered in this tutorial). \r\n\r\nIf you are running Tiger (10.4) or lower, you can jump down to the section for 10.4 users. \r\n\r\n[size=3]10.5 Users[/size]\r\n\r\nIf you are running Leopard (10.5) then you must compile Fink from source. \r\nDownload the latest source code from https://www.finkproject.org/download/srcdist.php\r\nThe next part is covered by the INSTALL file in the tarball, so to be brief, open a terminal window and do as follows:\r\ncd (wherever the tarball was downloaded to)\r\ntar xvf fink-0.27.8.tar.gz\r\ncd fink-0.27.8\r\n./bootstrap\r\n\r\nThis will then take you through the install. It will ask you where to install fink, the default is to use /sw for the installation, and this tutorial will assume that Fink was installed to /sw. It will ask you what mirrors to use, the defaults are usually fine, or you can select whatever you want. The only important question it will ask is whether or not to enable the unstable tree.  For this select yes and continue with the installation.\r\n\r\nOnce the script has finished installing there is just one more step.\r\nAssuming you have installed Fink to /sw, run: '/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh'\r\nThis will set your path correctly. Now skip to the Installation section.\r\n\r\n[size=3]10.4 Users[/size]\r\n\r\nTiger and below users can install Fink from the binary available on the Fink website.\r\nDownload the appropriate binary from: https://www.finkproject.org/download/index.en.php\r\nMount the .dmg file and install using the package installer.\r\nAfter the installer finishes, you're done, with the exception of enabling the unstable tree. The Fink FAQ has a good section on this, but it's pretty simple:\r\nrun 'fink configure' in a terminal shell and when it asks about the unstable tree says yes to enable it.\r\nNext run 'fink selfupdate' and 'fink scanpackages'\r\nNow you're done!\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]Installation[/size]\r\n\r\nNow that Fink is set up, installing rtorrent should be quite simple.\r\n'fink install rtorrent' in a terminal shell\r\nLet Fink download and compile the necessary files, if you get errors, the output should tell you what you need, (for me it was the right gettext pacakge), run 'fink selfupdate' and try again (it may take a few tries).\r\n\r\nAssuming everything went fine you've now got rtorrent on OSX!\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]Configuration[/size]\r\n\r\nYou'll need a configuration file to set things up.\r\nThe rtorrent homepage has a good example of a .rtorrent.rc file. https://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/browser/trunk/rtorrent/doc/rtorrent.rc?rev=latest\r\nSave that file in your home directory (~/.rtorrent.rc) and uncomment the options you want.\r\n\r\nYou probably want to make a session directory too (I put mine at ~/.rtorrent)\r\n\r\nYou are now done! Go to a terminal and type 'rtorrent' and add your torrents etc...\r\n\r\nGood Luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I left anything out, please post about it, this is my first tutorial, but I know there are a lot of people running OSX who are unhappy with their clients, so I thought I would write this up.\r\n\r\nTutorial made by kardia",

    "title": "rTorrent: Installing On Linux",
    "body": "[b]** updated 10/30/2007 with links to newest versions **[/b]\r\n\r\nSince rtorrent is now the recommended Linux client on many trackers, it's time for a tutorial to help those not so familiar with installing stuff on Linux. This will cover everything you need to get rtorrent up and running.\r\n\r\nYou might be able to get everything you need from your distro's official repositories, but there are too many distros for me to cover how to do that, and most of the time they contain extremely outdated versions. So I'll show you how to compile and install the newest versions.\r\n\r\nFor this tutorial, I will assume that you already have new enough versions of the standard software/libraries needed to compile and install programs on Linux, such as GCC/G++, pkg-config, OpenSSL, automake, etc. Sorry, I will not cover how to upgrade/install these, but your distro's official repositories should have all of these (even if they are not the latest versions, they should still work).\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=blue]Before you start, make sure you are logged in or SU'd to root. If you don't know what this is then learn more about Linux before continuing.[/color][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Prerequisites[/b]\r\nFirst of all, install the prerequisites for rtorrent. At the time of this writing, they are:\r\n\r\n    * libsigc++ >= 2.0.x\r\n    * libcurl >= 7.12.x \r\n\r\n1) Head over to the libsigc++ official website ([url]https://libsigc.sourceforge.net/stable.shtml[/url]) and download the sources.\r\n[quote]root@beast:~# wget https://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libsigc++/2.0/libsigc++-2.0.18.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n\r\n2) Extract the files\r\n[quote]root@beast:~# tar zxf libsigc++-2.0.18.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n\r\n3) Compile and install libsigc++\r\n[quote]root@beast:~# cd libsigc++-2.0.18\r\nroot@beast:~/libsigc++-2.0.18# ./configure\r\nroot@beast:~/libsigc++-2.0.18# make\r\nroot@beast:~/libsigc++-2.0.18# make install\r\nroot@beast:~/libsigc++-2.0.18# cd ..[/quote]\r\n\r\n4) Now you need to install libcurl. Compiling it with c-ares support is recommended so rtorrent doesn't hang on hostname lookups. So first go to the c-ares page ([url]https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/c-ares/[/url]), dl, extract, compile and install.\r\n[quote]root@beast:~# wget https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/c-ares/c-ares-1.4.0.tar.gz\r\nroot@beast:~# tar zxf c-ares-1.4.0.tar.gz\r\nroot@beast:~# cd c-ares-1.4.0\r\nroot@beast:~/c-ares-1.4.0# ./configure\r\nroot@beast:~/c-ares-1.4.0# make\r\nroot@beast:~/c-ares-1.4.0# make install\r\nroot@beast:~/c-ares-1.4.0# cd ..[/quote]\r\n\r\n5) Now go to the curl page ([url]https://curl.haxx.se[/url]) and do the same, but make sure you configure it with c-ares support.\r\n[quote]root@beast:~# wget https://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.17.1.tar.gz\r\nroot@beast:~# tar zxf curl-7.17.1.tar.gz\r\nroot@beast:~# cd curl-7.17.1\r\nroot@beast:~/curl-7.17.1# ./configure --enable-ares\r\nroot@beast:~/curl-7.17.1# make\r\nroot@beast:~/curl-7.17.1# make install\r\nroot@beast:~/curl-7.17.1# cd ..[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]libtorrent and rtorrent[/b]\r\nlibtorrent and rtorrent go hand in hand. Each one has to be installed with the other, and libtorrent must be installed before rtorrent. You must install both each time you decide to upgrade rtorrent.\r\n\r\n1) Go to the official site ([url]https://libtorrent.rakshasa.no[/url]) and dl both stable source archives.\r\n[quote]root@beast:~# wget https://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/downloads/libtorrent-0.11.8.tar.gz\r\nroot@beast:~# wget https://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/downloads/rtorrent-0.7.8.tar.gz\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n2) Install libtorrent\r\n[quote]\r\nroot@beast:~# tar zxf libtorrent-0.11.8.tar.gz\r\nroot@beast:~# cd libtorrent-0.11.8\r\nroot@beast:~/libtorrent-0.11.8# ./configure\r\nroot@beast:~/libtorrent-0.11.8# make\r\nroot@beast:~/libtorrent-0.11.8# make install\r\nroot@beast:~/libtorrent-0.11.8# cd ..\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n3) Install rtorrent\r\n[quote]\r\nroot@beast:~# tar zxf rtorrent-0.7.8.tar.gz\r\nroot@beast:~# cd rtorrent-0.7.8\r\nroot@beast:~/rtorrent-0.7.8# ./configure\r\nroot@beast:~/rtorrent-0.7.8# make\r\nroot@beast:~/rtorrent-0.7.8# make install\r\nroot@beast:~/rtorrent-0.7.8# cd ..\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b][color=blue]Installation is complete now. Exit out of root.[/color][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Configuring rtorrent[/b]\r\nThe rtorrent settings file is .rtorrent.rc in your home dir. rtorrent is highly customizable and there are many options. To get a list of all of them read the man page (man rtorrent) and check out the documentation on the web site. Just create a new file called .rtorrent.rc in your home dir and put your settings in there. Here are a few settings you absolutely must have for optimal performance:\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\nsession = ~/.rtorrent\r\nport_range = 31600-31610\r\nencryption = allow_incoming,enable_retry,try_outgoing\r\n[/quote]\r\nquick synopsis of these settings:\r\n\r\nsession = ~/.rtorrent - this will store torrents and torrent data in ~/.rtorrent so in case rtorrent crashes or you need to restart it, your stats will be kept. You can change this to whatever dir you want. just make sure that the directory exists.\r\n\r\nport_range = 31600-31610 - the port range that rtorrent will listen on. rtorrent by default listens in 6881-6889 which is blocked by most ISPs, so this is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nencryption = allow_incoming,enable_retry,try_outgoing - optimal encryption settings which will try to establish an encrypted connection and if it's not possible, fail over to unencrypted/legacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it! I suggest printing out the key bindings section of the man page for easy reference. at first it looks arcane and confusing, but after a few days of using rtorrent exclusively, all the keystrokes will become second nature!\r\n\r\nTutorial made by Vazhin",

    "body": "So, you're encountering issues with slow upstream speeds and it seems like the uploads level off at 0, right?  Maybe you're using Comcast or another similar ISP that is employing bandwidth shaping or using \"Sandvine.\"  Damn your ISP!  But you aren't without options!  Here are the different methods which people use in an effort to combat these terrible nuisances... and if none of them work, feel free to switch to a different provider in protest or find a workaround that nobody else has thought of.\r\n\r\n[color=#0000FF][size=4][b]1. VPN - Virtual Private Network[/b][/size][/color]\r\nThis will more than likely cost you some extra money a month.  You have a few options:\r\nRelakks: https://www.relakks.com/?cid=gb\r\nWitopia: https://www.witopia.net/personalmore.html\r\nVPNTunnel: https://www.vpntunnel.co.uk/\r\nMetropipe: https://www.metropipe.net\r\nHotspot Shield - Free but AD supported: https://www.anchorfree.com/downloads/hotspot-shield/\r\n\r\nThere are more and a simple google search can help you with this one.  Here are guides for setting up a VPN for each OS:\r\nWINDOWS VISTA:\r\nhttps://www.publicvpn.com/support/Vista.php\r\n(ignore the stuff that's included in and after the 'Select the Connection Properties' section)\r\nWINDOWS XP:\r\nhttps://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Configure-VPN-Connection-Windows-XP.html\r\nLINUX:\r\nhttps://www.linuxhelp.net/guides/vpn/\r\n(not sure if this is the right guide)\r\nMAC OS:\r\nhttps://www.external.ameslab.gov/is/remote-vpn-osx.html\r\nReplace the connection info with whatever VPN you choose for any of these tutorials and it should work.\r\n\r\n[color=#006633][b]The upside[/color][/b]: This usually works for most people.  It's even better if you have multiple computers and just use one to seed.  If you seed with just that one computer, connect to a VPN with that computer.  This should give you a constant stream upwards and you'll get your ratio up in no time.  But don't go into this thinking it'll uncap your upstream... you can only go the max that your provider gives you up... and sometimes the VPN might limit it a bit lower, depending on the VPN you choose.\r\n[color=#FF0000][b]The downside[/color][/b]: If you only use one computer then most VPN's tend to have sketchy service.  The downstream might be intermittent on a VPN.  Sometimes it might be hard to connect to them.  That and most of these places you have to pay 5 bucks a month or more.  I have the luxury of having a seeding computer connected to a VPN and a laptop that I just use without a VPN.\r\n\r\n[color=#0000FF][size=4][b]2. Force encryption[/b][/color][/size]\r\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/273456/Optimize-BitTorrent-to-outwit-traffic-shaping-ISPs\r\n\r\n[color=#006633][b]The upside[/b][/color]: It's a free option.  It's a quick fix, if it works out for you.\r\n[color=#FF0000][b]The downside[/b][/color]: A lot of people say it doesn't really work.  But some people swear by it... so give it a shot if you have nothing else to lose.\r\n\r\n[color=#0000FF][size=4][b]3. Seedboxes[/b][/color][/size]\r\nThe most expensive option of the bunch, but a guaranteed success.  Here are some host names:\r\nVectoral, LeaseWeb, Netdirekt, Tzulo, Exportal, OLM.net -- There are more and this is a subject you'll have to research...  Basically you are renting out a remote machine that'll do the seeding for you.  You'll have massive upstream and downstream capabilities, making it easier to get a good ratio.  It's a great option if you have the cash to spend.  Here's a good launching pad on getting to know what a seedbox is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox \r\n\r\n[color=#006633][b]The upside[/b][/color]: Insane upstream means you'll get a great ratio (most places offer a great upstream package, just choose wisely.)  It also means that no matter what your provider does to you... it won't affect your seedbox!  Not to mention being able to store your files on a remote computer... that has great advantages.\r\n[color=#FF0000][b]The downside[/b][/color]: Cost... These things can be as \"cheap\" as 50 bucks a month (if you're lucky...) but generally range around $85-$90 (US) a month... or more.  AND... Most seedbox providers have it in their TOS that they don't want you using it for illegal files.  They can shut off your service whenever they please.\r\n\r\n[COLOR=#0000FF][size=4][b]4. SSH Tunneling[/b][/color][/size]\r\nI list this one last because, well... I just plain don't like it.  It can cripple the servers of the SSH providers, and make those providers unreliable or force them to take measures as well.  If you REALLY want to do this option, and it will cost you at least a buck, then you can read the info over at torrent freak.  Here's the link:\r\nhttps://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-over-ssh-071014/  --  No upside and downside to this section, as I basically said it all.\r\n\r\n[COLOR=#0000FF][size=4][b]5. WIPFW[/b][/color][/size]\r\nThis option isn't really all that great because it requires all users to have performed this function before it'll be any good.  Which is highly unlikely to occur... but perhaps it can help you anyway...  Go here https://wakarimasu.googlepages.com/home and follow the instructions provided within and it just may help you combat things like sandvine on the comcast network, but I can't speak for the other ways different ISP's throttle your bandwidth.\r\n[color=#006633][b]The upside[/b][/color]: It's free.  It could completely combat sandvine on comcast\r\n[color=#FF0000][b]The downside[/b][/color]: It really only works for \"Sandvine\" type throttling.  Sandvine throttling sends a drop signal to both the receiver and sender so if both don't have this workaround installed, this won't work.  In a perfect world everyone would unite together, but we all know that isn't happening.  Also, this method isn't fully tested yet so it's too early to tell its effectiveness.\r\n\r\n======================\r\n\r\nHope this information is of use to someone, let me know your results or other workarounds you've discovered so I can add it here.  --zombieslayer (aka remisser on other sites)\r\n\r\nTutorial made by remisser\r\n\r\nNote from [url=https://what.cd/user.php?id=42]?[/url] (Administrator): Be careful when using VPN's and clear it with someone at every tracker you use it on.

    "title": "Transmission: Creating torrents and seeding on Mac",
    "body": "Transmission is a fairly simple torrent client to create torrents with, short and quick steps. So first when you open up Transmission, you want to go to File>Create Torrent File...\r\n[img]https://img29.picoodle.com/img/img29/4/2/11/f_Picture1m_dca6e70.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThen a window will appear asking you which file you want to make a torrent out of. Navigate to the file or folder of your choice, and click Select.\r\n[img]https://img03.picoodle.com/img/img03/4/2/11/f_Picture2m_12c6ff0.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThe next window will ask you to input the tracker of your choice, any comments if you wish, where the file torrent file should be created, and if the torrent you want to make should be private or not. For this tutorial, I am going to be using the What.cd tracker. What.cd includes your passkey in the tracker, so there is no need to redownload the torrent from What when you create the torrent. Your tracker URL with your unique passkey can be found on the upload page. So copy and paste that into the Tracker box. Now in this tutorial, I will be uploading to What.cd which IS a private torrent tracker, so I will need to have the Private Tracker box checked. Also, in Transmission, there is no way to change the piece size, so we will have to leave it at the default setting. For the \"Open when created\" box, you can have this checked because your passkey is included in the tracker URL. After you have all of this put in, click Create.\r\n[img]https://img30.picoodle.com/img/img30/4/2/11/f_Picture3m_947e9e8.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nTransmission will then proceed to create the torrent file.\r\n[img]https://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/2/11/f_Picture4m_a2cd2e6.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nAnd the torrent will appear in the Transmission window when finished if you selected \"Open when created.\"\r\n[img]https://img37.picoodle.com/img/img37/4/2/11/f_Picture5m_c911c7d.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nAll that is left now is to upload the torrent, and start seeding. Your newly created torrent should show up in the Transmission window.\r\n\r\nGo to the Upload page on What.cd, and put in all the required information about the torrent. Click Choose file, and locate the torrent file you just made with Transmission, then click Choose. Once you have all the required information in the Upload page, click Do it! at the bottom of the page, and the next window will appear saying that you have successfully uploaded your torrent.\r\n[img]https://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/4/2/11/f_Picture6m_a28cc7c.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]https://img03.picoodle.com/img/img03/4/2/11/f_Picture7m_0005d00.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nNow go back to Transmission and click the little spiral arrow button next to the torrent. Transmission will then check the existing data, and start to seed.\r\n[img]https://img26.picoodle.com/img/img26/4/2/11/f_Picture8m_fa81fe4.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nIf you get an error, such as Transmission telling you the torrent is not complete and you cannot start seeding, recheck the files by highlighting the torrent in the Transmission window, and going to Transfers>Verify Local Data, and Transmission will recheck the file or folder for that torrent to make sure it is 100% complete so you can start seeding.\r\n\r\nThis concludes creating, and seeding a torrent with Transmission on Mac OS X. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]Common problems[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[b]When I upload a torrent, and redownload it to seed, the progress stays at 0% and tries to download instead of seed.[/b]\r\nMake sure your download location is set to where the files are located. So for example if you have MP3 files located in \"X:/Torrents/My Torrent/\" go to Transmission>Preferences>Transfers, and set the \"Download to:\" location to \"X:/Torrents/.\" Or you can set it to \"Same as torrent file\" if your torrent will be in the same location as the .torrent file (Ex: If your .torrent file is on the Desktop, your folder of MP3s or whatever you are trying to seed must be on the desktop), or set it to \"Always ask me\" if you want to choose the location for yourself every time you import a torrent.\r\n\r\nTutorial made by Symmetry1618\r\n\r\n[color=red] [b]Issue with ripping on a mac and creating a torrent using the files from a (virtual or real) windows OS client (such as utorrent) to seed along with the mac version[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nWhen you rip a CD in OSX, you will create resource forks (.filenames) that are invisible files. Most programs that are native to OSX will [b]NOT[/b] pick up these files and wrap them into the torrent that you create. However, if you use utorrent for windows or a virtual machine installation of windows (VMWARE for example) and have utorrent or any other torrent client find the files you ripped on the mac side, they [b]WILL[/b] suck them into the torrent creation and your torrent will have a lot of .filenames like so:\r\n\r\n[quote][pre]\r\nXXXXXXXX@XXXXXXX-desktop:/media/Ishmael/MusicLibrary/Yeah No/Swell Henry$ ls -la\r\ntotal 54652\r\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-30 20:21 .\r\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       0 2008-12-30 20:21 ..\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._01 She Has Four Thorns.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7315990 2008-06-13 17:51 01 She Has Four Thorns.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._02 Last Beginning.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 6714129 2008-06-13 17:51 02 Last Beginning.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._03 Born In The Air.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7334798 2008-06-13 17:51 03 Born In The Air.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._04 Camper Giorno.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7765505 2008-06-13 17:51 04 Camper Giorno.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._05 Cloud Stopper.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 5364957 2008-06-13 17:51 05 Cloud Stopper.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._06 Flanked.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 2639654 2008-06-13 17:51 06 Flanked.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._07 He Has A Pair Of Dice.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 5416366 2008-06-13 17:51 07 He Has A Pair Of Dice.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._08 Dead Water.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 5853969 2008-06-13 17:51 08 Dead Water.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._09 Staircase Genius.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4560594 2008-06-13 17:51 09 Staircase Genius.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 2008-12-27 04:57 ._10 Kip Files.mp3\r\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 2932435 2008-06-13 17:51 10 Kip Files.mp3\r\n[/pre][/quote]\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, either create the torrent IN OSX (like above) and copy the torrent to windows, OR in your folder options on the windows side select \"see hidden files\" and delete the .filenames out of the directory before you create the torrent.\r\n\r\nThis will prevent messy torrents from being uploaded and you can use the torrent on both your windows and mac clients.",

    "body": "Grouping your torrents is an excellent way of keeping things organized. In this tutorial, I will be teaching you how simple it is to get this going. First get a general idea of how you want to group. Some ideas to get you started is grouping by tracker or by different tags such as movies, applications, music etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]1.[/b] Open transmission\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b]\r\n\r\n[img=https://img201.imageshack.us/img201/5646/picture1jp0.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]3.[/b]\r\n\r\n[img=https://img.skitch.com/20080806-d24m8u1edhgib4gianimgc4xfu.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]4.[/b]  Type in your preferred group name. \r\n\r\n[img=https://img.skitch.com/20080806-gea6icd3y25ap5esawgntiycha.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]5.[/b] [i](Optional)[/i] Color coding your groups is great for finding things visually which is usually quicker but depends on the person.\r\n\r\n[img=https://img.skitch.com/20080806-effyt84a4p4u3h2egx3kq2rs6e.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]6.[/b] If \"Queue Order\" is selected then you will notice that \"Use Groups\" is grayed out.

    "title": "Uploading: Etiquette Guide",
    "body": "Note: This guide [b]does not[/b] deal with creating torrents.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, on to the tutorial...\r\n\r\n\"What is this Uploading Etiquette thing?\", I hear you ask. Well, put simply, it is the torrenting equivalent of karma. Do good by uploading well-formatted and tagged torrents, and good shall come on to you (no, not that way. Get your mind out of the gutter).\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c176/jezuschryzt/confused.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\"Huh? Tell me more about Uploading Etiquette, Ryz!\"\r\n\r\nOk. As any good businessman will tell you, getting ahead in this world is all about shifting the paradigm and providing good customer service. The torrenting world is no different. It may surprise you, but people actually don't like to mess around with badly tagged and formatted files after they've downloaded them, and that's fair enough! They've put plenty of effort into gaining access to a highly-organised music pirating network, and they deserve some \"me time\".\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c176/jezuschryzt/depressed.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\"So what you're saying is that my files may be causing others unwanted grief?\"\r\n\r\nThat's right. However, by utilising some simple Workflow Synergy Knowledge Acquisition techniques, you could be everyone's favourite uploader in no time!\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c176/jezuschryzt/cautious.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\"I'm listening...\"\r\n\r\nFirst off, start by renaming all your files to a uniform format. The generally accepted format is \"Track # - Title\" or \"Track # - Artist - Title\" for compilations. If you're a masochist, you can rename every single one of your files manually. Otherwise, use a batch tagging/renaming program such as the appropriately named [b]Tag & Rename[/b] or its free (although less powerful) equivalent [b]Mp3Tag[/b]. These programs may also be used to retag files by imputting values manually or downloading them from an online database. Avoid using umbrella genre tags such as \"Alternative and Punk\". Alternative is an adjective, not a genre, just like High Yield Investment Programs are legitimate financial options, not pyramid schemes.\r\n\r\nIf your files are formatted and tagged well, people can download them straight into their library (instead of making duplicate copies to seed), and will thus be able to keep seeding for a longer period of time.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c176/jezuschryzt/appreciation.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\"I see. So by putting a little extra effort into formatting my files I can increase downloads by 200% per annum without a large capital outlay?\"\r\n\r\nCorrect. You can also enhance the potential downloader's experience by putting extra information on the torrent page. While I do automatically download any Insane Clown Posse album that's posted, I prefer to know a little bit about other albums before taking the proverbial plunge. A review (easily found at sites such as [b]allmusic.com[/b] or [b]music.amazon.com[/b]) or even just a few sentences that describe the album's sound do go a long way towards informing the other users' choice of whether or not to download an album. You wouldn't go to a coke party blindfolded, so why would you download an album if the only thing you know is the tracklisting?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, instead of posting a plain tracklisting, why not create an nfo file that also includes useful information such as bitrate, encoder, audio source, track times and sizes, and the album length. Free programs such as [b]Kleinvaag's PostAssistant[/b] and [b]NFO Sighting[/b] make it a breeze!\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c176/jezuschryzt/ecstatic.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\"Wow, Ryz! Armed with that sort of info there's no telling what lofty heights I can scale! Thanks!\"\r\n\r\nNo problem, buddy.\r\n\r\nTutorial made by Ryz",

    "title": "Uploading: the same files to different private trackers",
    "body": "First of all let me say that I didn't write this guide. Thewimp from waffles.fm did(building on some posts from tich). So be sure to send thanks their way. All I did was cut and paste it because I thought it would be helpful here too. I asked thewimp first if your curious and he said sure (so much for this waffles/what animosity). Long live the hydra. \r\n\r\nNote: This guide is for uploading files to two trackers. If you would like to seed the same files on two trackers even though they have the same hash(when you add them you get a \"this torrent is already in your client message) There are two solutions. One is to run two seperate clients, or two instances of one client. The other is to see this helpful guide:\r\n\r\n[quote=thewimp]HOW TO UPLOAD THE SAME FILES TO 2 PRIVATE TRACKERS.\r\n\r\nstep by step guide using [b]uTorrent 1.6[/b]\r\nby: thewimp\r\nthanks to: Tich\r\n\r\nintroduction:\r\nThis tutorial will explain how to upload an album to two different private trackers.\r\nI have seen some people doing things like adding 2 trackers to the same torrent job, this is a bad thing and \r\nwill be flagged as cheating. So I decided to write this tutorial to help people do it the right way. Tich was the first to talk about that on the other thread, so the kudos go to him. :)\r\nThe tutorial was made using uTorrent 1.6, but may work with any version.\r\n\r\nCREATING THE FIRST TORRENT\r\n\r\nfirst you will need some album to upload. I'll use an imaginary one, let's call it \"waffos - best hits\"\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://imageupload.se/files/071113/8008img1.PNG[/IMG]\r\n\r\nnow you have to upload it to the tracker, but first you'll need to create the torrent:\r\nopen uTorrent, click on 'create new torrent'.\r\na window will pop, now follow the instructions:\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://imageupload.se/files/071113/6142img2.PNG[/IMG]\r\n\r\n1 - click on 'add directory' and point to the folder you want to upload.\r\n2 - paste the tracker url from waffles upload page/use your url with the passkey.\r\n3 - since this is the first torrent you will create, it's recommended to leave this option on auto detect.\r\n4 - UNTICK start seeding, [b]TICK private torrent.[/b]\r\n5 - click on 'create and save as...' button, the progress bar below it will fill up, and you'll be asked where you want to save the .torrent. \r\n\r\nclick on 'close' button.\r\n\r\nnow you can see a new job added to uTorrent, you may want to label it, or just leave it on No Label category.\r\nclick on the torrent job, you'll notice some tabs below it, click on the general tab, now you have to check the 'piece size' used by uTorrent .\r\n\r\nthis is needed because:\r\n1 - the piece size was set to auto during torrent creation so you need to know what size was used.\r\n2 - you will have to select a different piece size for the second torrent\r\n\r\npic:\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://imageupload.se/files/071113/700img3.PNG[/IMG]\r\n\r\nnow go to the upload page on waffles and select the .torrent you have created, upload it and start seeding.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL STEPS: if you have used the standard tracker url (i.e. without passkey), you may have to download the .torrent file on the upload page in order to proper seed it. To do this, just download it from the page, open uTorrent, select the new torrent job you have created, CLICK ON REMOVE BUTTON (otherwise uTorrent will try to add new tracker to existing job), add the new .torrent you downloaded and point it to your album folder (in this case: G:\\waffos - best hits).\r\n\r\nnow you're done with the first torrent, let's create the second torrent to upload to what.cd tracker.\r\n\r\nCREATING SECOND TORRENT\r\n\r\nclick on create a new torrent, the same window will popup.\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://imageupload.se/files/071113/9259img4.PNG[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAs you can see on the pic above, the folder will be the same as the first (YOU DON'T NEED TO MODIFY THE FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER).\r\nNow you have to use the what.cd tracker, get it from your what.cd upload page.\r\nIMPORTANT STEP: this is the where you do the trick, you'll have to select a different piece size for the new torrent. In this example, the first torrent have a piece size of 512 kB, so I'll select a close number, like 256 or 1024 kB.\r\nUntick start seeding, TICK private torrent.\r\nClick on 'create and save as...' and save the new .torrent on a different location, or with a different name (otherwise uTorrent will ask to overwrite the first one). remember to keep your .torrent stored because you may need them on the future.\r\nuTorrent will add a new job and now you can see 2 exactly identical torrents on the job list, but one is for waffles and the other is for what. I strongly suggest that you create labels for better management of your upload jobs.\r\nupload the new torrent to what.cd and start seeding.\r\n\r\nthat's it, you now have 2 identical torrents on two different private trackers. :w00t:\r\n\r\nplease suggest corrections or additions to the tutorial.\r\ncheers. :)[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI'm going to add some things that have been discussed in the comments:\r\n1) If for whatever reason you have managed to get two seperate torrents listed in your torrent client(seperate hashes), and you are 100% sure that each torrent is only announcing to one tracker then you are fine. I don't know how you managed to do it, but congratz. The vast majority of users cannot get separate torrents without changing the hash size.\r\n\r\nTutorial made by SilentFury",

Unlike many torrent clients, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent  does not tax valuable system resources; typically using less than 6MB of memory.\r\n\r\nThis Guide will cover the \"Installation\", \"Setup\" and \"Optimization\" of the \u00c2\u00b5Torrent BitTorent Client.  I have tried to make this guide clear, concise and complete.  To this end, most settings are color coded and highlighted in the illustrations; a brief explanation is also included.  Some calculations are needed, but nothing beyond simple arithmetic.  My hope is that everyone, to some degree, will find this guide helpful.\r\n[color=green]To make the separate sections stand out, each will be preceded by the \u00c2\u00b5Torrent Icon[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/Icon100px.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Download and Install[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Initial Setup[/b]\r\n\r\n     Speed test\r\n     Connection Type and Speed Setting\r\n     Port Check and Forwarding\r\n     Protocol Encryption\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Optimizing the Internet Connection[/b]\r\n\r\n     Tweaking the Network Settings\r\n     Windows XP SP2 and the Event ID 4226 Patch\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]\u00c2\u00b5Torrent \"Preferences\"[/b]\r\n\r\n     General\r\n     Downloads\r\n     Connection\r\n     BitTorrent\r\n     Queueing \r\n     Scheduler\r\n     Other\r\n     Advanced\r\n     Disk Cache\r\n     User Interface\r\n     Web UI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/Icon100px.png[/img] \r\n\r\n\r\n[b][url=https://www.utorrent.com/download.php]Download[/url] and Install \u00c2\u00b5Torrent[/b]\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.utorrent.com/download.php]Download[/url] the latest stable version of \u00c2\u00b5Torrent.

The only difference between the two is that the \"Installer Version\" will create \"Start Menu\" and \"Desktop\" shortcuts during the installation process; however, on first run, the \"Stand Alone Version\" will ask if you would like to make shortcuts on your start menu and desktop.

For the initial setup of \u00c2\u00b5Torrent,\r\nyou can use the \"Advertised\" (claimed) Max Upload Rate from the Internet Service Provider (ISP),\r\nbut by doing a speed test you can more accurately judge your current line throughput or internet connection speed.\r\nIt is advisable to do a speed test when prompted.\r\n\r\n1)\t[color=maroon]Stop all internet traffic before proceeding with the test.[/color]\r\n2)\tVisit one of the numerous speed testing sites such as [url=https://www.dslreports.com/speedtest][color=blue]DSL Reports[/color][/url], [url=https://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/][color=blue]Speakeasy[/color][/url] or [url=https://www.speedtest.net][color=blue]Speedtest.net[/color][/url]. \r\n3)\tPerform the test several times.

Software ports are numbered connections that a computer uses to sort network traffic. \r\nA port may support incoming traffic, outgoing traffic, or both.\r\n\r\nWhen a computer on the internet sends data to the external IP Address of your router, the router needs to know what to do with the data.  \r\nPort Forwarding tells the router, to which computer, on the local area network (LAN) to send the data. \r\nWhen you have port forwarding rules set up, the router takes the data from the external IP Address / port number and sends that data \r\nto an internal IP Address / port number.  Port Forwarding rules are created per port, so a rule set up for port 6881 will only work for port 6881, \r\nand therefore a port can only be used by one program at a time!\r\n\r\n\r\nPick any random port between 49152 and 65535, the \"Unassigned\" port range and enter that port number \r\nin the \"Current Port\" field.  Click the \"[b]Test if port is forwarded properly[/b]\" button to check the port you have chosen.  \r\nThe Default Browser will open and test the chosen port's mapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/utorrent%20Speed%20Guide/PortCheckOpen.png[/img]\r\n\r\nIf the \u00c2\u00b5Torrent Port Checker displays this message, congratulations your port is open and accepting connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/utorrent%20Speed%20Guide/PortCheckClosed.png[/img]\r\n\r\nIf the \u00c2\u00b5Torrent Port Checker displays this message, the port is not \"Open\", go to [url=https://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm][color=blue]Portforward.com[/color][/url]  and allow the site to guide you \r\nthrough the forwarding process.  You will need to know the Router and/or Modem manufacturer, Model and the Username and Password; \r\ncheck the manual if the passwords suggested by [url=https://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm][color=blue]Portforward.com[/color][/url] don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/utorrent%20Speed%20Guide/5SpeedGuide.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]D)  Protocol Encryption[/b]\r\n\r\nSome Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are actively interfering with P2P activities to reduce their bandwidth requirements.\r\nThis causes the download speeds of file sharing programs, to become slow.

This gives the user numerous options including which files to download.\r\n\r\n[b]Activate the program window[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will activate (Open), when a torrent file (.torrent) is opened.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Other Settings[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Append .!ut to incomplete files[/b] - When enabled, the extension \u00e2\u20ac\u0153.!ut\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be added to incomplete file names; this will provide a visual queue for incomplete files.\r\n\r\n[b]Prevent stand-by if there are active torrents[/b] - When enabled and there is an active torrent, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will prevent your PC from entering the Standby (Sleep) mode (turns off all nonessential hardware, including the monitor, hard drives, and removable drives).\r\n\r\n[b]Pre-allocate all files[/b] - When enabled, the space required for the complete torrent download, is reserved on the hard drive.\r\n\"Pre-allocate all files\" cannot be used in conjunction with \"bt.compact_allocation\", or \"diskio.sparse_files\".  This option does not have an impact on fragmentation of your hard drive, as \u00c2\u00b5Torrent already allocates each file upon writing to disk even without this option. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/uTorrent%20Preferences/3Connection.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Connection[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nConnection Preferences allow the user to properly configure the connections port, proxy and bandwidth settings.  To optimize a given connection it is vital to have an open port and that it is properly mapped (forwarded) through the Modem and/or Router\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Listening Port[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Port used for incoming connections:[/b] - Specifies the port \u00c2\u00b5Torrent uses to listen for incoming connections; this port must be open to firewalls.\r\n[color=green]If you have manually forwarded the \u00c2\u00b5Torrent port, enter that port number in the field provided[/color].  \r\n\r\n[b]Random port button[/b] - Selects a random port between 10000 and 65000\r\n \r\n[b]Randomize port each time \u00c2\u00b5Torrent starts[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will select a random port between 1024 and 5000 to use at startup.\r\n[color=green]This option may conflict with manual port forwarding; If you have manually forwarded the \u00c2\u00b5Torrent port, disable this option[/color].\r\n \r\n[b]Enable UPnP port mapping[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will use the \"Universal Plug and Play Device Host\" Windows Service (UPnP) to communicate with the router and automatically forward a port.  Some devices do not support UPnP, therefore it may still be necessary to manually forward the \u00c2\u00b5Torrent port.  Disable UPnP if this is the case.\r\n  \r\n[b]Add \u00c2\u00b5Torrent to Windows Firewall exceptions[/b] - Allows \u00c2\u00b5Torrent to add an entry to the Windows Firewall exceptions list that lets it bypass the firewall. This is useful only if you actually have Windows Firewall enabled. Note that this option works only on Windows XP with at least Service Pack 2 (SP2) installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Proxy Server[/b]\r\n\r\nWhile a Viable option, the use of a Proxy Server will inhibit Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file transfers\r\n\r\n[b]Type[/b] - Choose the Proxy Server type from the drop down menu.  \"HTTP\" proxies cannot be used for Peer-to-Peer connections.\r\n \r\n[b]Proxy[/b] - Enter the proxy's URL or IP address.\r\n \r\n[b]Port[/b] - Enter the proxy's port.\r\n \r\n[b]Authentication[/b] - When enabled, this setting allows for automatic log in on Secure Proxy Servers. \r\n\r\n[b]Username[/b] - Enter the \"User Name\" as required for authentication.\r\n\r\n[b]Password[/b] - Enter the \"Password\" as required for authentication.\r\n\r\n[b]Use proxy server for peer-to-peer connections[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will communicate and transfer data with peers through the proxy. By default, this option is disabled, and \u00c2\u00b5Torrent only uses the proxy, to communicate with trackers. \r\nNote:  Peer-to-Peer communication cannot be used with HTTP proxies. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Bandwidth Limiting[/b]\r\n\r\nThe settings in \u00c2\u00b5Torrent are directly proportional to the Maximum Upload Rate (MUR).  To properly optimize \u00c2\u00b5Torrent, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Set for Best Speeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is vital to have an accurate measurement of the MUR.\r\n\r\nTo get the most accurate reading on your system, do numerous tests, from various testing sites, to diverse testing servers, at different times of the day.  After getting these speeds, take an average and use this average, expressed in kilo bits per second (kb/s), as your MUR.\r\n  \r\n        [color=green]Maximum Upload Rate[/color] (kb/s) = ( test 1 + test 2 + test 3 +\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 test n ) / n          Where \"n\" is the number of tests in the \"Average\" \r\n\r\nTo do a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Speed Test\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, [color=maroon]Stop all internet traffic before proceeding[/color] and use one of the numerous speed testing sites such as [url=https://www.dslreports.com/speedtest][color=blue]DSL Reports[/color][/url], [url=https://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/][color=blue]Speakeasy[/color][/url] or [url=https://www.speedtest.net][color=blue]Speedtest.net[/color][/url].  Please note, Internet Service Providers (ISP) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Advertise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd speeds in kilo bits / sec (kb/s) and \u00c2\u00b5Torrent speeds are set and reported in kilo Bytes / sec (kB/s).  1 kilo Byte  / sec (kB/s) = 8 kilo bits / sec (kb/s)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Global maximum upload rate (kB/s): [0: unlimited][/b] - The maximum upload rate for all active torrents combined.  If this speed setting is too high, the internet connection can quickly become choked.  75% of MRU (rounding down) is generally accepted as \"Optimal\".  This setting is the upper limit, all adjustments should be made downward.\r\n\r\n        [color=green]Global maximum upload rate[/color] (kB/s) = 0.75 ( Maximum Upload Rate (kb/s) / 8 )\r\n\r\n[b]Alternate upload rate when not downloading (kB/s):[/b] - When enabled, allows the user to define an alternate upload rate, when no torrents are in downloading mode (only uploading). Other than the context in which it is active, this upload rate limit behaves exactly like the \"Global Maximum upload rate\".\r\n\r\n[b]Global maximum download rate (kB/s): [0: unlimited][/b] - The maximum download rate for all active torrents combined.  While 0, or \"Unlimited\" is the default and usual setting, it is suggested that 95% of the maximum download rate in kB/s will result in a more stable network connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/uTorrent%20Preferences/4BitTorrent.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]BitTorrent[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Number of Connections[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Global maximum number of connections[/b] - The maximum number of connections \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will make at any given moment for all active torrents.  The optimal setting is by coincidence the Maximum Upload Rate (MUR) expressed in (kb/s)\r\n\r\n        [color=green]Global maximum number of connections[/color] = Maximum Upload Rate (kb/s)\r\n\r\n[b]Maximum number of connected peers per torrent[/b] - The maximum number of peers \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will connect to, at any given moment for each separate torrent.  The optimal setting is the Maximum Upload Rate (MUR) expressed in (kb/s) divided by eight ( 8 )\r\n\r\n        [color=green]Maximum number of connected peers per torrent[/color] = Maximum Upload Rate (kb/s) / 8\r\n\r\n[b]Number of upload slots per torrent[/b] - The maximum number of peers \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will upload to, at any given moment for each separate torrent.  This setting is always at the very least, one (1) and can be expressed as the [u]Global[/u] Maximum Upload Rate in (kB/s) divided by four (4).\r\n\r\n        [color=green]Number of upload slots per torrent[/color] = [u]Global[/u] Maximum Upload Rate ([u]kB/s[/u]) / 4\r\n\r\n[b]Use additional upload slots if upload speed < 90%[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will open more upload slots if the current total upload speed is less than 90% of the \u00e2\u20ac\ufffd[b]Global maximum upload rate[/b]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Additional BitTorrent Features[/b]\r\n\r\nDistributed Hash Table (DHT) and Peer Exchange (PEX), are an alternate means of getting peers, from other peers instead of through the tracker; this is particularly useful on poorly seeded torrents, or when the tracker is unavailable. \r\n \r\nDHT and PEX should always be disabled when using a private tracker, since they can become problematic.  Some problems which may occur are the leakage of personal information and connecting to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unregistered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd clients, which will result in invalid statistics. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Enable DHT Network[/b] - When selected, the Distributed Hash Table (DHT), will be enabled.\r\n\r\n[b]Enable DHT for new torrents[/b] - When selected, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will check for peers from the DHT network on each newly added torrent.  This option only works if the DHT Network is enabled, and if the 'Private' flag is not set in the .torrent file. \r\n\r\n[b]Enable Local Peer Discovery[/b] - When selected, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will attempt to discover local peers via multicast.  If a peer is considered local, transfer rates with the peer will not be limited unless Limit local peer bandwidth is also enabled.  Local peers will not be added to the peer list for .torrent files with the 'Private' flag set. \r\n\r\n[b]Ask tracker for scrape information[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scrape the tracker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Request new Peer and Seed information).  By default, the tracker is scraped only when the torrent job is started, but this can be changed using the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bt.scrape_stopped:\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd setting in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Advanced Preferences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \r\n\r\n[b]Enable Peer Exchange[/b] - When selected, Peer Exchange (PEX) for each newly added torrent will be enabled, provided the 'Private' flag is not set for that .torrent file. \r\n\r\n[b]IP/Hostname to report to tracker[/b] - Enables the user to specify the IP address when reporting to the tracker.  This is used when the IP address is not reported correctly to the tracker; in example when using a proxy server.  A hostname may be entered in this field; therefore if a dynamic DNS service is in use, the domain can be entered here.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Protocol Encryption[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Outgoing:[/b] - There are 3 Protocol Encryption modes available in the dropdown menu.  All modes will accept incoming encrypted connections, and the encryption is 2-way.\r\n \r\n        [b]Disabled[/b] - \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will attempt to establish only unencrypted outgoing connections.\r\n\r\n        [b]Enabled[/b] - \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will establish encrypted and unencrypted outgoing connections, depending on how the peer responds to the handshake.  \r\n        This is the recommended option, as it allows \u00c2\u00b5Torrrent to connect to the largest number of peers. \r\n\r\n        [b]Forced[/b] - \u00c2\u00b5Torrent is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Forced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to establish only encrypted outgoing connections.  Any peer that doesn't support encryption\r\n        will not be connected to.  It is recommended that this option be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enabled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unless the ISP actively searches for \r\n        unencrypted incoming connections.  This can significantly impair the ability to connect to peers. \r\n\r\n[b]Allow incoming legacy connections[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will establish unencrypted incoming connections. If disabled, any incoming connection that is unencrypted will be ignored.  It is recommended that this option be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enabled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unless the ISP actively searches for unencrypted incoming connections.  This can significantly impair the ability to connect to peers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/uTorrent%20Preferences/5Queueing.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Queueing[/b]\r\n\r\nQueueing Preferences, allow the user to set parameters, at which torrents will start, stop and the speeds at which the torrent will seed. \r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Queue Settings[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[b]Maximum number of active torrents[/b] - The total maximum number of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unforced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd active torrents, before placing torrents in the queue.  Torrents are counted regardless of whether they are uploading, or downloading, as long as the speed is at least 1 kB/s.\r\n\r\nThis is a personal preference setting, but a certain amount common sense and restraint is needed.  The total available connection bandwidth will be split between active torrents, therefore the maximum connection upload and download speed must be taken into account.\r\n\r\n[color=green]Four (4) is a good, general use number, with which to start[/color].  If you have numerous sporadically seeded torrents the number can easily be raised, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Forced Start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n[b]Maximum number of active downloads[/b] - The maximum number of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unforced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd downloading torrents, before placing torrents in the download queue.  This option only applies to torrents that are downloading or are to be placed in downloading mode. \r\n\r\nUsing the same reasoning as stated in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maximum number of active torrents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section, a low number is suggested.  A valid strategy is to keep this setting low and allow the torrents to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Queue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; as one torrent finishes, another will start.\r\n\r\n[color=green]One (1), or two (2) at most, to start[/color].  If for some reason a higher number is desired, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Forced Start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Seed While [Default values][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Ratio is: <=___%[/b] - This setting enables the user to select the ratio at which \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will stop, or throttle the speed of seeding torrents.  Setting the ratio to -1 is equivalent to setting it to unlimited.  A value of zero (0) will cause \u00c2\u00b5Torrent to ignore the ratio parameter and use the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or seeding time is:\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd setting only.  This value is interpreted as a percentage, please enter it as such.  \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will throttle the seeding process only after both this and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or seeding time is:\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have been reached. \r\n\r\n[b]or seeding time is:[/b] - This setting enables the user to select the maximum amount of time you wish a torrent to continue seeding, at normal speeds after it has finished downloading.  \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will throttle the seeding process, only after both this and the ratio threshold have been reached. \r\n\r\n[b]Seeding tasks have higher priority than downloading tasks[/b] - When enabled; seeding tasks will have a higher priority than downloads.   If the maximum number of active torrents is reached, and a torrent reaches seeding state, the downloading tasks will not force it into a queued seeding state. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]When \u00c2\u00b5Torrent has reached the seeding goal[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Limit the upload rate to [use 0 to stop torrent]:[/b] - This setting enables the user to select the speed at which \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will throttle a torrent when it reaches the seeding goal. A value of zero (0) will stop the torrent.  This value is expressed in kB/s. \r\nForce Start takes the selected torrent job(s) out of queue order (makes it ignore queueing) and forces it to start immediately, even if the maximum number of active torrent jobs and/or downloads has been reached. Forced torrent jobs will not stop even if they reach the seeding goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/uTorrent%20Preferences/6Sheduler.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Scheduler[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nThe \u00c2\u00b5Torrent Scheduler allows the user to create schedules controlling bandwidth according to time and day of the week.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Enable Scheduler[/b] - Enables the \u00c2\u00b5Torrent Scheduler when checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Scheduler Table[/b]\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tEach square in the table represents, horizontally each hour per day and vertically the day of the week.

Specify the IP address of the adapter.\r\n\r\n[b]net.outgoing_ip[/b] - Makes \u00c2\u00b5Torrent use a specific LAN adapter for all outgoing connections only. Specify the IP address of the adapter.\r\n\r\n[b]net.outgoing_port[/b] - Makes \u00c2\u00b5Torrent use a single outgoing port. This should only be used in specific cases. This can be used with full cone NAT routers, to reduce the number of NAT table entries and thus, prevent crashes. \r\n\r\n[b]net.low_cpu[/b] - Reduces CPU use slightly.  Unless the system is significantly slow, leave this setting off.\r\n\r\n[b]net.max_halfopen[/b] \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The number of  half-open (incomplete) connection attempts \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will make at any one time.  Windows Vista, Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2003 Server SP1 limit the maximum concurrent half-open connections (SYN) to a maximum of 10 (the previous limit was over 65,000).  The drawback to this connection limit is, network intensive applications can be slowed, this includes Peer-to-Peer (P2P) clients like \u00c2\u00b5Torrent.\r\n\r\n          [color=maroon]Do not change this setting without first changing (patching) the [b]TCPIP.SYS[/b] file, using the [b]Event ID 4226 Patch[/b][/color].\r\n\r\n          To change the limit on maximum concurrent half-open connections, effectively editing the [b]TCPIP.SYS[/b] file, use the Event ID 4226 Patch.\r\n\r\n          A complete guide can be found here:  [url=https://fora.demonoid.com/index.php?topic=120502.0][color=blue]Windows XP SP2 and the Event ID 4226 Patch[/color][/url]\r\n          Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2003 Server SP1 [url=https://lvllord.de/?lang=en&url=downloads][color=blue]Download[/color][/url]\r\n          Windows Vista [url=https://www.yaronmaor.net/repair.htm][color=blue]Download[/color][/url]\r\n\r\n          To change the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[b]net.max_halfopen[/b]\" setting, enter the desired \"Value\" in the field provided and click \"Set\".\r\n\r\n          To truly optimize \u00c2\u00b5Torrent, set the limit to 50 and use \u00c2\u00b5Torrent normally; periodically check the [b]Windows Event Viewer[/b] for\r\n          Event ID 4226 errors; if these errors are found, raise the limit by 50, continuing this process, until these errors are no longer logged.\r\n\r\n          To access the Windows Event Viewer, navigate to:    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd > \"Run\" > Enter \" [color=green]eventvwr.msc[/color] \" > Click \"Ok\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]net.wsaevents[/b] - Intended to address unusual firewall problems.

With automatic management (-1),  \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will limit DHT bandwidth based on the Max Upload Rate;  this limit ranges from 512 to 8192. [b]dht.rate[/b] uses your Max Upload Rate divided by 16 to determine this value, to improve DHT performance.\r\n\r\n[b]rss.update_interval[/b] - Sets the update interval for RSS.  Values lower than 5 will be ignored, and remain at 5.\r\n\r\n[b]gui.update_rate[/b] - Sets the refresh interval for the GUI in ms; the minimum is 500ms.\r\n\r\n[b]gui.delete_to_trash[/b] - Sends deleted files to the recycle bin.  This can also be enabled by right clicking on the remove toolbar icon and checking \"Move to trash if possible.\"\r\n\r\n[b]gui.default_del_action[/b] - Sets the default remove action.  This option should not be modified directly, and instead should be modified by right clicking the \"Remove\" toolbar icon while holding \"Shift\" and choosing the \"Remove\" option you want to be default.\r\n\r\n[b]gui.bypass_search_redirect[/b] - Sets \u00c2\u00b5Torrent to search directly on the selected search engine rather than being redirected through https://search.utorrent.com. \r\n\r\n[b]queue.dont_count_slow_dl/ul[/b] - Forces \u00c2\u00b5Torrent to not count torrents going less than 1KB/s up, or down towards the active torrents.\r\n\r\n[b]queue.prio_no_seeds[/b] - Prioritizes torrents that have no seeds when seeding.\r\n\r\n[b]bt.scrape_stopped[/b] - Enables or disables scraping the tracker for torrents that have been stopped (not queued).\r\n\r\n[b]bt.compact_allocation[/b] - Allows \u00c2\u00b5Torrent to create files similar to the Python scripting method, to save space. Do not use this option with [b]diskio.use_partfile[/b].  This option may not work properly.  The associated error is \"Element not found\". \r\n\r\n[b]bt.enable_tracker[/b] - Enables or disables the embedded tracker.  The tracker URL is https://your.ip:port/announce\r\n\r\n[b]bt.multiscrape[/b] - This turns on/off multi-scrape, which is sending multiple hashes per scrape. You should not have to change this option, since \u00c2\u00b5Torrent automatically detects when a tracker doesn't support it.\r\n\r\n[b]bt.send_have_to_seed[/b] - Enabling this option sends a message to other seeds indicating how many pieces you currently have.\r\n\r\n[b]bt.set_sockbuf[/b] - A debugging option to auto detect the TCP buffer size (so_sndbuf) and adjust it based on the upload speed.\r\n\r\n[b]bt.connect_speed[/b] - Controls the number of connections per second \u00c2\u00b5Torrent makes.\r\n\r\n[b]bt.prio_first_last_piece[/b] - Enabling this option prioritizes the first and last pieces of each file in a torrent.\r\n\r\n[b]bt.allow_same_ip[/b] - Allows multiple connections from the same IP. Generally this should not be used, since it weakens the anti-leech protection.\r\n\r\n[b]bt.no_connect_to_services[/b] - Disallows connecting to peers using a remote port of 25 or 110. This should only be used if you really, really want to keep your e-mail detection on in your anti-virus.\r\n\r\n[b]peer.lazy_bitfield[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent does not send the complete bitfield, but a sample of it, so as to prevent blocking of seeding.\r\n\r\n[b]peer.resolve_country[/b] - Makes \u00c2\u00b5Torrent use a DNSBL service to determine a peer's country.\r\n\r\n[b]peer.disconnect_inactive[/b] - This enables or disables disconnecting from inactive peers after a set period of time (default being 5 minutes). However, it will NOT disconnect if the number of peers in the swarm is lower than the value set for maximum number of connections per torrent.\r\n\r\n[b]peer.disconnect_inactive_interval[/b] - Sets the time interval waited, before breaking an inactive connection.   This value is interpreted in seconds and the default is 5 min.  It is suggested that a higher value may result in greater connection stability. \r\n\r\n          [color=green]peer.disconnect_inactive_interval[/color] = 600\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]diskio.flush_files[/b] - Enabling this option closes file handles every minute. This helps reduce the effect of Windows managing the system cache badly for some people and causing so-called \"memory leaks\".\r\n\r\n[b]diskio.sparse_files[/b] - Enabling this option allocates only the data that has been written.  This option is only availabale to hard drives partitioned as NTFS (2k/XP/2003).  This option will increase fragmentation, but save space while downloading.\r\n\r\n[b]diskio.use_partfile[/b] - This is used to store data that is downloaded from files that marked as \"Do not download.\" This is necessary to prevent the file from being allocated and stores the parts of the files that come with a piece, since \u00c2\u00b5Torrent must download and save the entire piece, which can include data for files you didn't want to download. Avoid using this in conjunction with compact allocation.\r\n\r\n[b]diskio.smart_hash[/b] - This makes \u00c2\u00b5Torrent hash data from memory (if in the write queue), instead of flushing to disk, re-reading from disk, and then hashing. This should help reduce reads, especially at high speeds.\r\n\r\n[b]diskio.coalesce_writes[/b] - Tries to minimize the number of writes to disk, by writing more data at once. It doesn't have any effect at on download speed, but might increase memory and CPU usage to achieve less disk writes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q77/dvsdmn/uTorrent/uTorrent%20Preferences/9DiskCache.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Disk Cache[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nThe disk cache is used to keep frequently accessed data in memory, to reduce the number of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reads & Writes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the hard drive.\r\n\u00c2\u00b5Torrent normally manages the cache automatically, but you may change its behavior by modifying these settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Disk Cache[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Override automatic cache size and specify the size manually:[/b] - Enables the user to set a new maximum memory usage for the disk cache.

[color=maroon]This option should not be used if you wish to minimize disk access[/color].\r\n\r\n     [b]Write out finished pieces immediately[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will write a piece to disk once it is completed in memory.\r\n     [color=maroon]This option should not be used if you wish to minimize disk access[/color].\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Enable caching of disk reads[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will use the disk cache to store frequently read data into memory, from disk.\r\n[color=green]This has the effect of decreasing the frequency of reads from disk[/color].\r\n\r\n     [b]Turn off read caching if the upload speed is slow[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will disable read caching, if upload speed is below 40 KB/s.  \r\n     This lowers memory usage when the cache is not needed.  [color=maroon]This option should not be used if you wish to minimize disk access[/color].\r\n\r\n     [b]Remove old blocks from the cache[/b] - When enabled, \u00c2\u00b5Torrent will remove chunks of read cache data, from memory if they have not been\r\n     accessed for 10 minutes.

    "title": "uTorrent: Make Your Own Tracker",
    "body": "If you've got a large amount of data to transfer from one place to another, we all know BitTorrent is an extremely efficient way of doing it.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes you may want to transfer data which you don't want to (or can't) upload to a tracker on the internet.\r\n\r\nThis is where uTorrent comes in handy, because it can act as your own private tracker.\r\n\r\nYou'll need a few things before you begin:\r\n\r\n1.  A recent copy of uTorrent.  1.7.5 is the latest version, there's no excuse not to use it.\r\n2.  Your external IP address.  You can use https://www.whatismyipaddress.com to find this.\r\n3.  Your listen port in uTorrent.  You can find this in uTorrent's Options > Preferences > Connection > Port used for incoming connections.\r\n4.  You must be clever/connectable!  This won't work if you don't have port forwarding correctly configured.\r\n\r\nHere's what you need to do.  Open up uTorrent and go Options > Preferences > Advanced.  Scroll down to find bt.enable_tracker and set it to True.  Restart uTorrent for this to take effect.\r\n\r\nNow, create a new torrent.  As usual, browse to find the file or folder you wish to share.\r\n\r\nFor the tracker url, use the following information:\r\n\r\nhttps://your_ip_address:your_listen_port/announce\r\n\r\nSo, for example, if your IP address is 123.123.123.123 and your listen port is 54321 then you would put this as your tracker url:\r\n\r\nhttps://123.123.123.123:54321/announce\r\n\r\nRemember to tick 'Start Seeding'.  Tick 'Private Torrent' to disable DHT and Peer Exchange for this torrent if you want to.\r\n\r\nNow press 'Create and save as..' and save the .torrent file somewhere.  uTorrent should now connect (to itself) and the tracker status should be 'working'.  You'll note it has a 10 minute announce interval. \r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it.  You can now send that .torrent file to someone, they can open it in their torrent client and start downloading the content.\r\n\r\nWant something more fancy than an IP address?  Get yourself a domain name from somewhere like https://www.dyndns.com/services/dns/dyndns/\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting:  If the connect times out and can't find the tracker, you've done something wrong.  Ensure you've got the correct IP address, port, and that uTorrent is definiately connectable from the outside.  You can run uTorrent's test for that by going to Options > Speed Guide and clicking Test if port is forwarded properly.  Also, ensure you have a colon separating the IP address and port number! \r\n\r\nNot mine, got it from azc a while back at Oink.\r\n\r\nTutorial made by hotemetoot",

    "body": "First off all credit to yui (bitmetv) if you see this and mind my reposting please let me know.\r\n\r\nFor Utorrent\r\n\r\n\r\n==========================================================\r\n\r\nThis is a noob guide. Only for those who are extremely lost.\r\n\r\nBasic concept :\r\n\r\n1.   Set the download location of the file to the file you have on your computer.\r\n2.   Set the file priority to \"do not download\" (this is a precaution i like to take).\r\n3.   Hash-check through the file(s).\r\n4.   You are ready to seed!\r\n\r\n* You might want to make a backup copy of the files as a precaution.\r\nIt is possible to lose files (ie season packs) if you aren't careful : )\r\n\r\n==========================================================\r\n\r\nIn uTorrent :\r\n\r\n0.   Open the .torrent file in uTorrent. You should get a dialog box as shown in the screenshot below. If not, follow this :\r\n\r\nQuote:\r\nGetting the \"Add new torrent\" dialog box to show up :\r\n\r\n1. If uTorrent has been configured to start torrents automatically without showing the add torrent dialog box, either unconfigure it (see #3)\r\n    or add the torrent through File -> \"Add Torrent (no default save)\" menu option.\r\n2. To turn on the Add New Torrent dialog box, go to Preferences -> Downloads -> make sure \"Always show dialog box on manual add\" is checked\r\n3. To display the list of files in the \"Add New Torrents\" dialog box, Go to Preferences -> Downloads -> and check \"Show a window that displays the files inside the torrent\".\r\n\r\n(Thanks folk for the tip.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   Click on the \"...\" button, set the download location to the file on your computer.\r\n2.   Make sure \"Skip hash check\" is unchecked.\r\n3.   Uncheck the files in the bottom box. This tells uTorrent not to download the file.\r\n4.   Click Ok.\r\n\r\n             [img]https://img489.imageshack.us/img489/5905/addnewtorrentmh6.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n5.   The progress of the hash-check process will be displayed in the 'Status' column.\r\n6.   Additional file information can be viewed by clicking on the \"Files\" tab.\r\n7.   The percentage of the file which you have is displayed in the 'Done' and '%' column.\r\n\r\n   [img]https://img304.imageshack.us/img304/4299/filestabhq6.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nDone!",

Take a Python interpreter here: https://www.python.org/download/ and install it.\r\n2. Copy script from here: https://paste.uni.cc/17825 [b](v2.0)[/b] and paste in your text editor (i.e. Notepad)\r\n3. Save as [b]seed.py[/b] to the directory where the \"problem\" torrent file is located (i.e. C:\\torrents)\r\n4. Go to [b]Start -> Run...[/b] , type [b]cmd[/b] and click OK\r\n5. Change current directory to the aforementioned one (i.e. type [b]cd c:\\torrents[/b])\r\n[b]Important:[/b] Exit uTorrent and wait for its process to finish (wait for one minute to be sure, or check for the presence of utorrent.exe in Task Manager)\r\n6. Start script with torrent filename(s) as one or more arguments: [b]seed.py \"torrent filename #1\" [\"torrent filename #2\" [...]][/b], i.e. [b]seed.py \"Torrent file.torrent\"[/b]\r\n  6.1. If you have a separate installation of uTorrent (with .dat files in the same directory with utorrent.exe), input the path to you resume.dat file (i.e. \"c:\\utorrent\\1.8 alpha\\resume.dat\" ) as the first argument, like this: [b]seed.py \"c:\\utorrent\\1.8 alpha\\resume.dat\" \"Torrent file.torrent\"[/b] (but your uTorrent executable file must have a name \"utorrent.exe\" for the script to work)\r\n7. Follow the instructions on screen\r\n8. When script finishes, start your uTorrent and seed the new file as you do normally.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Current version is 2.0. Older version is here: https://paste.uni.cc/17782 (for uTorrent 1.7.* only)\r\n\r\n[b]Everyone[/b], feel free to post any questions/problems concerning this script.\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that version 2.0 is out: https://paste.uni.cc/17825\r\nChangelog:\r\n + Now works with any version of uTorrent (tested on versions 1.6.1, 1.7.5 and 1.8 beta)\r\n + There is no need now to start/stop uTorrent for every torrent file from argument string (a window will pop up, you just need to select all files and drag to uTorrent window)\r\n + Works with a separate installation of uTorrent (if you input a path to resume.dat file as the first argument, the script will work with utorrent.exe from the same directory)\r\n\r\n[b]Question:[/b] if you were not to do this, would you still be able to seed?[/quote]\r\n[b]Answer:[/b] Technically, yes. But you shouldn't.\r\nWhen you get this message: [quote]The torrent you are trying to add is already in the list of torrents. Do you want to load the trackers from it?[/quote] you must click \"No\", because other way uTorrent will report incorrect (bigger) upload amount to trackers, and that could be considered as cheating.\r\n\r\nTutorial made by [url=https://what.cd/user.php?id=10195]Oniisan[/url]",

    "title": "uTorrent: WebUI Tips and Tricks",
    "body": "Upon setting up a functioning WebUI your first goal should be to familiarize yourself with the interface... but it's usefulness can be expanded greatly from the base setup shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you should do is probably setup a Dynamic DNS for it, what that means is if you have a residential connection with an IP that changes every now and then, you can have one address you, or for that matter anyone else can access your stats from (hopefully everyone else atleast uses an approved guest account).\r\n\r\nThe easiest way of doing this is through a free service hosted by the guys at https://www.dyndns.org\r\n\r\nOpen up their site and create an account, then go ahead and create a free Dynamic DNS Host. You will be confronted with a page asking for a hostname prefix and suffix. The prefix can be anything you want, there is a drop down box for the last part of your address.\r\n\r\nCheck wildcard and leave TTL at 60s... leave everything else as is, now install the DynDNS updating software onto the machine with uTorrent. If not available install it on a often online machine that runs in the same network under the same public IP.\r\n\r\nYou should now be able to access the uTorrent WebUI from anywhere without worrying about IP changes. Just use it this way:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nameone.nametwo.com:port/gui/\r\n\r\nNow that you're set to access the interface anywhere and anytime we can make the WebUI more practical and efficient by using an extension for Firefox.\r\n\r\nGrab this extension https://bin.thinkpond.org/site/utorrentext/download.html here (For FireFox 3.* or greater, snag the latest release from here: https://thinkpond.org/downloads.html )\r\n\r\nInstall by dropping the saved file into your Firefox window.\r\n\r\nYou'll see a new addition on the bottom bar of Firefox, it should say \"uTorrent Not Running\".\r\n\r\nRight click on this and fill in the proper details... sadly I've found that this extension just plain doesn't work with a Dynamic DNS host. The easy fix is to just use your IP in that area, and if it buggers out, check https://www.whatismyip.com/ for your current one. If the machine your on isn't on the same network as uTorrent, and you're not sure of the new IP you might have pulled at home or elsewhere, just ping your DynDNS host and you'll see the new IP (In Windows: Start>Run>Type \"cmd\">Hit OK> Type: ping www.host.name.com and hit \"enter\").\r\n\r\nThe extension once configured will allow you to toggle a sidebar of your uTorrent WebUI by left-clicking on it, and possibly the coolest part is it's display of some minor info right on your browser's window. Not to mention that people who want to get on torrents plain fast without any fuss can merely drag the link to the .torrent file and drop it on the readout of the WebUI and after a little delay see a new download starting as per the default save location set in their uTorrent client.\r\n\r\nIf you use a separate headless machine just for seeding this is massively useful. \r\n\r\nAs a final task you can setup a nifty script that makes any old WebUI anywhere out there interface with mIRC.\r\n\r\nOpen up mIRC and hit Alt+R, in the resulting window choose the remote tab.\r\n\r\nCreate a new fresh slate by going into File and choosing the aptly titled \"New\".\r\n\r\nNow copy and paste this text into your fresh working ground:\r\n\r\n[quote]The Script Wrote:\r\n; type /uthelp for info\r\n\r\nalias ut_getinfo {\r\n\r\n  ; -============================ CHANGE THE VALUES BELOW ============================- ;\r\n\r\n  ; the username for the webui:\r\n  var %ut_username (Name)\r\n\r\n  ; the password for the webui:\r\n  var %ut_password (Password)\r\n\r\n  ; the hostname or ip of the machine running \u00c2\u00b5torrent, if \u00c2\u00b5torrent + webui is running on the same computer leave it at localhost\r\n  set %ut_url (Location...

    "title": "BitTorrent Jargon",
    "body": "[center][color=#FFAA00][size=6]BitTorrent Jargon[/size][/color][/center]\r\n(Thanks to TorrentFreak for most of this. I did some grammar/spelling correction and added some extra ones as well.)\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3].torrent File:[/size][/color] A .torrent fille contains all the info you need to download the file you want. For example, a torrent file has info on the size, the filename, and how to connect to other people (tracker). Another important function of the .torrent file is that it has a \u201chash\u201d (sort of a digital signature) of each part of the file to make sure you don\u2019t download corrupt or fake data but \u201cthe real thing\u201d.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Client:[/size][/color] The BitTorrent client is the application you use to \u201cload\u201d the .torrent file so that you can connect to other people. There are a lot of different torrent clients available. The three most popular clients are Bitcomet, Azureus and uTorrent. If you\u2019re new to BitTorrent I would recommend uTorrent, it\u2019s light and has a great settings wizard to help you on your way.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Indexer:[/size][/color] Indexers are websites which list (index) .torrent files (myBitTorrent, Torrentz, Mininova etc.).\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Seeder:[/size][/color] A seeder is someone who has a complete version of the file you are downloading. If there are no seeders, you probably wont be able to get the file. So seeders are extremely important, make sure to \u201cseed\u201d the torrent once you finished downloading.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Leecher:[/size][/color] A leecher is someone who is downloading (and uploading) a file. You are a leecher if you do not have a complete copy of the file you\u2019re trying to get. Note that a leecher normally is someone who\u2019s not uploading, that\u2019s not true in the BitTorrent jargon.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Peer:[/size][/color] A peer is the same as a leecher, but without the negative connotation.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Global Ratio:[/size][/color] The data you uploaded divided by the data you downloaded. A ratio higher than 1.00 means that you upload more than you download, which is a good thing. Most private trackers keep track of your ratio and will ban or block you if you have a bad ratio. Try to get at least a 1.00 or higher ratio.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Torrent Ratio:[/size][/color] Same as above, but for a single torrent instead of your overall data. Most places require you to seed each torrent to at least 1:1 (meaning you've uploaded as much as you've downloaded) before you can safely delete it.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Scrape:[/size][/color] Scraping means that your BitTorrent client is requesting info from the \u201ctracker\u201d about other people who are downloading or uploading the file. This is important because you need to know who has pieces of the file you still need.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Tracker:[/size][/color] The tracker is a server that has all the info about the people that are down- and uploading the file. The tracker itself does not have a copy of the file, it only tracks the up- and dowloaders and makes sure people are able to connect to each other. A tracker is not the same as a website that hosts torrents. Mininova for example is not a tracker, just a \u201ctorrent-site\u201d.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Super-Seed:[/size][/color] Some clients have the option to \u201csuper-seed\u201d (also known as \"Initial seed\" in some clients). Super seeding is different from seeding because it tries to send out pieces of the file that have not been sent before. So instead of sending the same piece to several peers, it tries to send a unique piece to everyone so that other peers can swap those pieces.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]ReSeed:[/size][/color] Every once in a while, torrents do die. Its sad, but we've all come across a movie we'd been looking for for ages, and there's no seeds. What do you do? Ask for a reseed. Basically, its asking the person that uploaded the movie (or someone that has downloaded the movie in the past) to make it available for download again, which means having them readd the .torrent file to their client. It will hash the data, and automatically start seeding again, since they have the full file.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Swarm:[/size][/color] The swarm are all seeds and peers that are connected together. So if your client shows 5 seeds and 10 peers then that\u2019s your swarm.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]DHT:[/size][/color] DHT stands for \u201cDistributed Hash Table\u201d. DHT layers \u201cdecentralize\u201d torrents what make them more stable and less reliant on the web based trackers. If a web based tracker goes down, the torrents stay alive because peers can act as \u201cnodes\u201d keeping the swarm intact.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Peer Exchange:[/size][/color] Enables trading of peer lists with other peers that support \u00b5Torrent's implementation of Peer Exchange. It is disabled if the selected .torrent file has the 'private' flag set.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Local Peer Discovery:[/size][/color] Enables discovery of local peers via multicast. It is disabled if the selected .torrent file has the 'private' flag set.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Initial Seeding:[/size][/color] Enables a more bandwidth efficient method of seeding the torrent job(s). This should be used only if you are the sole seeder in the swarm, and if there are at least 2 peers connected. Generally, this option should not be used by people with high upload speeds.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Announce:[/size][/color] Every so often the client \"announces\" to the tracker, asking it for new Peer information. You can do what's called a Manual Announce, which is sort of like a web browser refresh button, but it adds extra strain to the tracker and is usually frowned upon, and sometimes even punishable if done in excess.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFAA00][size=3]Announce URL:[/size][/color] Your Personal Announce URL is a unique link that the tracker uses to credit you with your data transfer, as in how much you have uploaded/downloaded, and the data gets appended to your Global Ratio.",

    "title": "Movie Sources",
    "body": "This article is intended to describe the various sources the films uploaded to our site can originate from. This can be important when considering the quality of a file. Not all of these sources are permitted for upload on TehConnection but they are here so this list is complete.\r\n\r\nThe titles of each source follow a format of [color=red]Name of Source (Tag)[/color]. The tag is how that source is represented by members of the Scene and p2p groups when naming their releases. This is what to look for when checking files for upload to TehConnection. There are multiple tags for some sources types and it is usually up to the uploader's personal preference which one they use.\r\n\r\nThis article makes an important distinction between pre-retail and retail sources. Retail sources are the best quality available and when they are uploaded to TehConnection all pre-retail formats of a particular film are immediately removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Pre-retail Release Formats[/b][/size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]CAM[/b] (CAM)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA CAM is a cinema recording usually done with a digital video camera. A tripod is sometimes used but a lot of the time this wont be possible so the camera may shake. The seating placement isn't always ideal so it might be filmed from an awkward angle. If cropped properly this is hard to notice unless there's text on the screen but a lot of times these are left with triangular borders on the top and bottom of the screen. Sound is taken from the on board microphone of the camera and, especially in comedies, laughter can often be heard during the film. Due to these factors picture and sound quality are usually quite poor, but sometimes we're lucky, and the theater will be fairly empty and a fairly clear signal will be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Telesync[/b] (TS, CAM.TS)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA telesync is the same as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for hard of hearing people). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality ranges drastically, check the sample and screen shots before downloading the full release. A high percentage of telesyncs are often CAMs that have been mislabeled.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Telecine[/b] (TC)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA telecine machine copies the film digitally from the reels. Sound and picture should be very good, but due to the equipment involved and cost telecines are fairly uncommon. Generally the film will be in correct aspect ratio, although 4:3 telecines have existed. A famous example is the Jurassic Park 3 telecine. Telecine should not be confused with TimeCode, which is a visible counter on screen throughout the film.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Workprint[/b] (WP)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA workprint is a copy of the film that has not been finished. It can be missing special effects, scenes and music. Quality can range from excellent to very poor. Some workprints are very different from the final print (Wolverine was missing all the special effects) and others can contain extra scenes (Jay and Silent Bob). Workprints can be nice additions to the collection once a good quality final has been obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]DivX Re-encode[/b] (REEnc)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA DivX Re-encode is a film that has been taken from its original VCD source and re-encoded into a small DivX file. Most commonly found on file sharers, these are usually labeled something like Film.Name.Group(1of2) etc... Common release groups are SMR and TND. These aren't really worth downloading, unless you're that unsure about a film you only want a 200MB copy of it. Generally avoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Pay per view[/b] (PPV, PPVRip)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nPay per view rips generally originate from pay television stations from which you pay for each program (movie, television episode) you watch. Generally these originate from the Far East and are often not far behind theatrical releases. The quality is usually lower than standard analogue television rips.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Video on Demand[/b] (VOD, VODRip)[/size][/color]\r\nA rip sourced from Video on Demand services. Usually similar quality to Pay per view rips. The main difference is how the sale and distribution works in terms of the cable company and licencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Watermarks[/b] (WATERMARK)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA lot of films come from Asian Silvers/PDVD (see below) and these are tagged by the people responsible. Usually with a letter/initials or a little logo, generally in one of the corners. Most famous are the \"Z\" \"A\" and \"Globe\" watermarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Screener[/b] (SCR)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA pre-release VHS tape sent to rental stores and various other places for promotional use. A screener was commonly supplied on a VHS tape usually in a 4:3 aspect ratio, although letterboxed screeners were sometimes found. Screeners are less common now and have more or less been replaced by DVD screeners (see DVDScr below). The main draw back is a \"ticker\" (a message that scrolls past at the bottom of the screen with the copyright and anti-copy telephone number). If the tape contained any serial numbers or any other markings that could lead to the source of the tape these have to be blocked, usually with a black mark over the section. This is sometimes only for a few seconds but unfortunately on some copies this will last for the entire film and some can be quite big. Depending on the equipment used screener quality can range from excellent if done from a master copy, to very poor if done on an old VHS recorder through poor capture equipment on a copied tape. Most screeners were transferred to VCD, but a few attempts at SVCD have occurred, some looking better than others.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]DVD Screener[/b] (DVDScr)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nSame premise as a screener, but transferred off a DVD. Usually letterboxed or anamorphic, but without the extras that a retail DVD would contain. The ticker is not usually in the black bars, and will disrupt the viewing. If the ripper has any skill, a DVDScr should look very good. Usually transferred to SVCD or DivX/XviD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Region X[/b] (R8, R7, R6...)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nTypically these releases are high quality telecines intended for the East European market. The most commonly released are R5 and are released in Russian language only. These are an initiative to combat piracy in that region and are released very soon after a film's theatrical release. Ironically, these movies then have the English audio track from another source (such as a telesync) dubbed over them and are released. Until recently these releases have been tagged as R5 but we're starting to see similar sources from other regions tagged as R3 or R6. The number is derived from the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_region_code]DVD region[/url] the DVD is released in.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Region X (Blu-ray)[/b] (RC/3, RB/2)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nBlu-ray followed a similar [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc#Region_codes]region coding[/url] idea as DVD but with far fewer regions. Releases tagged as RC/3 are the Blu-ray equivalent to an R3 or an R5 DVD release.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Television Rip[/b] (TVRip)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nTelevision rips are episodes or movies capped from ordinary analogue television. They are the lowest quality television rips available.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Digital Satellite Rip[/b] (DSRip)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nDigital satellite rips are post air caps from a digital satellite transmission. They are roughly on par with PDTV rips.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Pure Digital Television[/b] (PDTV)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nPost air rips, usually from a PCI TV card that supports digital TV but not at a high definition resolution. This and HDTV are the most common formats for television releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]High Definition Television[/b] (HDTV)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nCommonly used to tag high definition television rips. Post air rips, usually from a PCI tv card that supports high definition television which is broadcasted digitally and at a very high resolution compared to regular television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Retail Release Formats[/b][/size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]VHS Rip[/b] (VHSRip)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nTransferred off a retail VHS, mainly skating/sports videos and XXX releases. Fairly uncommon now as VHS has all but died.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]DTheater[/b] (DTheater)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nDTheater, also known as [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTheater]D-VHS[/url], is a now defunct improved version of VHS which was designed to store digital video data. The standard was expanded and this format is able to store both standard and high definition video. With the wholesale adoption of both DVD and Blu-ray this source is not very common anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]DVD Rip[/b] (DVDRip, DVDRiP)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAn encoded copy of the final retail DVD. If possible this is released pre-retail (for example, Star Wars: Episode Two) and should be excellent quality. DVD rips used to be released in SVCD format and DivX but are now exclusively released as Xvid.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]HD-DVD[/b] (HDDVD)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA rip taken directly from an HD-DVD. These were common for a time before Blu-ray became the de facto standard for high definition media.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Blu-ray[/b] (Bluray, BluRay, BD, BDRip)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nBlu-ray Disc is an optical disc storage medium designed to supersede the standard DVD format. Blu-ray discs are in high definition format and as such are the best quality source commonly available.",

    "title": "Scene Tags Information",
    "body": "Have you ever looked at something you've downloaded and not understood what part of the file or folder name means? If so, this article is for you. Most Scene & p2p groups add [i]tags[/i] to their releases in order to better describe what they have released to any potential downloaders. You may run into a few of these tags here at TehConnection because we add some of them to our site to make it clearer what has been uploaded.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/TIu4k.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThe above shows where you will see certain tags added. Technically, 'Unrated' is also a tag but more on that later.\r\n\r\nA typical Scene movie release will look this:\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent]\r\nCharlie.and.the.Chocolate.Factory.PROPER.WS.DVDRiP.XViD-DEiTY\r\n[indent]\r\n./ CD1/Charlie.and.the.Chocolate.Factory.WS.DVDRiP.XViD.DEiTY.CD1.avi\r\n./ CD2/Charlie.and.the.Chocolate.Factory.WS.DVDRiP.XViD.DEiTY.CD2.avi\r\n./ Sample/Sample diety.charlie.avi\r\n./ Charlie.and.the.Chocolate.Factory.WS.DVDRiP.XViD.DEiTY.nfo\r\n[/indent]\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\nAs you can see there are a number of tags on both the folder and the files inside the folder. Typically, releases will follow the pattern [color=red][i]Movie.Name.Additional.Tags-GroupName[/i][/color]; this article will explain all the possible entries in the [color=red][i]Additional.Tags[/i][/color] fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Proper[/b] (PROPER)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAccording to scene rules, whomever releases the first DVDRip (for example) has won the 'race' for that movie. If the quality of that release is fairly poor and another group has another DVDRip (or the same source in higher quality) then the tag [i]proper[/i] is added to the folder to show that this release should be considered the winner. Proper is the most subjective tag in the scene, and a lot of people will generally argue whether the proper is better than the original release. A lot of groups release a proper just out of desperation due to losing the race. A reason for the proper should always be included in the NFO file.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Limited[/b] (LIMITED, LiMITED)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA movie tagged with [i]Limited[/i] means it had a limited theater run, usually opening in less than 250 theaters, generally smaller films (such as art house films) are released as limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Internal[/b] (INTERNAL, iNTERNAL)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA release tagged [i]internal[/i] means the particular release was not meant to be widely traded among Scene top sites. They are done for several reasons; usually at the request of a site operator or a group wanted to release a higher quality version of a classic film. Some internal releases still trickle down to IRC/newsgroups/Bittorrent, it usually depends on the title and the popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Straight to Video[/b] (STV)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nStraight to Video. As the acronym suggests, any film that was never released in theaters should have the straight to video tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Aspect Ratio[/b] (WS, FS)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThese tags denote a films aspect ratio. They are less and less common as DVDs are rarely released in a full screen (FS) or 4:3 aspect ratio and most DVDs come in some flavour of widescreen (WS), either 16:9 or 2.35:1.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Repack[/b] (REPACK, RERIP)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nIf a group releases a bad rip, they will release a [i]repack[/i] which will fix the problems. Rerip is a similar tag, simply denoting that a release was ripped from the source again.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Nuke[/b] (Nuke, Un-Nuke)[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA [i]nuke[/i] is a special case of tags applied by the Scene. These aren't applied to the file or folder and are handled by TehConnection in a special way. You will see this next to a torrent that has been nuked by the Scene.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/W3UoO.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nA release can be [i]nuked[/i] for various reasons. Individual sites will nuke a release for breaking their rules (known as a local nuke) but if the film has something extremely wrong with it (no soundtrack for 20mins, CD2 is incorrect film/game etc) then a global nuke will occur, and people will stop trading it across sites. Nuked films can still reach other sources such as Bittorrent/newsgroups, but its a good idea to check why it was nuked first in case. Often nukes will occur for a group failing to provide proof that they have the retail disc despite the release being perfect in all other regards.",

    "body": "[size=5][color=#4682b4]\u00b7TehConnection aims to be an archive site.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]This means that here at TehConnection, we are working towards providing a well-seeded archive of all available digital forms of cinema and film in their highest possible quality. We welcome you to upload old, outdated XviD and DivX releases, but only if a higher quality release is not already available, and know that when a superior quality release of the same format is uploaded, your upload will be removed.[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#4682b4]\u00b7TehConnection aims for quality.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]We therefore insist the usage of the highest quality codecs and encoders. Currently this entails the use of x264. If you are unsure how to encode content at archive quality, please refer to the Guides & Tutorials section of the forums. Users wishing to encode to XviD for the site must seek staff approval first. If you find a release that does not meet your expectations of quality, please do not hesitate to bring this to the staff's attention by reporting the torrent.[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#4682b4]\u00b7TehConnection is, above all else, a community.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]And not just a community within our own site, but extending among other trackers across the web. We therefore must insist that you respect the wishes of any site who wish to remain out of the public eye and do not mention any names, URLs, acronyms or any other information against the site's wishes.[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#4682b4]\u00b7TehConnection forbids the sale and/or trading of both invites and accounts.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]We actively work with staff at other sites to ensure that users who choose to ignore this rule, along with cheating, are banned on all private torrent trackers.[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#4682b4]\u00b7TehConnection expects maturity.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]To an extent. We expect you the user to treat other members fairly and politely. \"Trolling\" and other juvenile fun may be tolerated in small doses, however if you abuse this leniency you will be dealt with swiftly and severely. The user can expect a certain level of privacy. If a user violates the privacy of another user, they will be promptly banned. This extends to avatars as well. All avatars must be safe for work with no nudity and no graphic depictions of violence.[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#4682b4]\u00b7TehConnection is staffed by a dedicated group of volunteers.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]Do not abuse the staff. They do this for the pure, unadulterated joy that comes with sharing their love of cinema and technology melded together in perfect harmony. Respect their opinions, if you disagree, do not immediately resort to slamming down on your caps lock key, instead try to calmly and rationally explain your side of the argument. There is a chance your rhetoric will persuade the staff to agree with you.[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#4682b4]\u00b7You are allowed one account per lifetime.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]Your use of the site and of your account is not a right. You are not entitled to anything. Your account may be disabled at the staff's discretion with little or no warning. Users caught with multiple accounts will be immediately banned. If you are caught creating a new account after a previous account has been disabled for any reason this new account will be banned on sight. Sharing accounts is also prohibited, to avoid this, be aware of the strict limit of three (3) simultaneous IP addresses allowed per account.[/indent]",

    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]General[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe goal of this guide is to describe the creation of an informative torrent description that is presented in an appealing way. You can edit your uploaded torrents by clicking on [ED] from the torrent's film group page.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]MediaInfo[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nEvery x264 or Xvid torrent description must have an unaltered MediaInfo log added to the release description in the intended input box.\r\n\r\n[indent][list=circle]\r\n[*]Download [url=https://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en]MediaInfo[/url]... free, open-source and multi-platform.\r\n\r\n[*]Install, when you start the program for the first time a small window will show. Click \"OK\".\r\n\r\n[*]File -> Open -> Open file(s).\r\n\r\n[*]Browse to the movie's directory and select the movie file.\r\n\r\n[*]View -> Text\r\n\r\n[*]Copy and then paste everything under MediaInfo Output. (You can edit the 'Complete Name' file path to remove any personal identifiers)\r\n[/list][/indent]\r\n\r\nIf you need to add MediaInfo from a seedbox or similar, see [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=69]this guide[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Comments/Notes[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAny additional information that you want members to see when they look at your upload (e.g. \"Hard coded English subtitles.\" or \"Encoded from Criterion DVD\" and so forth), should be centered at the top of the description, and italicized to draw attention to them.\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre][center][i]**Add Your Comment Here**[/i][/center][/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nFor hardcoded subtitles: [indent][pre][center][color=red][i]Hardcoded subtitles[/i][/color][/pre][/indent]\r\nShould be placed first, on top everything else.\r\n\r\nNotes can also be placed within a spoiler tag when they are either very long or not vital that users see them (additional technical details etc...).\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre][spoiler=Notes]**Add Your Notes Here**[/spoiler][/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Screenshots[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nScreenshots should be placed within spoiler tags, since this allows a user to choose whether they want to view them. Screenshots must be in the lossless .png format; lossy formats like .jpg are prohibited, as they misrepresent the actual appearance of the video. Screenshots must also be the same resolution as the video plays at.\r\n\r\n[color=red]Do NOT use TDMaker.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red]Do NOT use imgur for HD screenshots as they compress large images.[/color]\r\n\r\nHow to add thumbnail screenshots:\r\n\r\nUpload your screens to an image host: [url=https://imgbox.com/]imgbox[/url] (remember to select \"resized\" thumbnails instead of the default \"square\" option), [url=https://www.imagebam.com/]ImageBam[/url] [/url] are all acceptable hosts...then copy/paste the BB-Code URLs generated.\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre][center][spoiler=Screenshots]\r\n*Paste image host BB-Code here*\r\n[/spoiler][/center][/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nHow to add 'Source vs. Encode' screenshots:\r\n\r\nUpload screens to a gallery on an image host like SomeImage or Imagebam. Choose 250x250 pixel (Resize, Keep aspect ratio, Width). BBCode will be generated at the bottom of the page.\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][pre][center][spoiler=Source vs. Encode]\r\n*Paste image host BBCode here*\r\n[/spoiler][/center] [/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule of thumb when choosing thumbnail sizes:\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n350 x 350 Keep aspect ratio -- this setting is good for solo screens\r\n250 x 250 Keep aspect ratio -- this setting is ideal for source vs. encode screens; where you want the screens to appear side by side\r\n150 x 150 Keep aspect ratio -- this setting is ideal for when you are comparing source vs. encode1 vs. encode2; where you want 3 screens to appear side by side\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][b]Check upload after to make sure screens look good.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]NFO Files[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nShort for 'information' and pronounced 'info', NFO is a file name extension used with text files which accompany a main file providing descriptions and meta-data. Used most commonly in the Warez Scene to mark files as originating from a particular release group. NFO files will often contain elaborate ASCII art along with info about the group and the particular release. These should be included, untouched, with any scene releases as they act as a calling card and give credit where credit is due while also providing important technical specifications about the release. NFO files can be opened with a text editor and the contents copied into the Release Description box in the upload form. Placing them in spoiler and pre tags will ensure the ASCII displays correctly while keeping the description neat.\r\n\r\nHow to add an NFO file:\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][code][spoiler=NFO][pre]**Paste NFO contents here**[/pre][/spoiler][/code][/indent]\r\n\r\nFor an NFO file that has ASCII Art that is too wide to fit within a spoiler, use size=2\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][code][spoiler=NFO][size=2][pre]**Paste NFO contents here**[/pre][/size][/spoiler][/code][/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Sample, NFO & Screenshot Comparison Links[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nOften links are needed to be placed within a torrent description e.g. Sample Link, Full NFO Link and a [url=https://screenshotcomparison.com/]Screenshot Comparison[/url] link. A suggested format for presenting these links is this:\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][code][center]| [url=**Link**][color=#FF045F]SCREENSHOT[/color][b][color=white]COMPARISON[/color][/b][/url] | [url=**Link**]NFO[/url] | [url=**Link**]SAMPLE[/url] |[/center][/code][/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][i]A model example of a great release description.[/i]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/3Znjs.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]DVDR Description[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA DVDR is an exact replica of a DVD disc that can include all of the menus and extras from the retail disc and act as a source for an x264 encode in many cases. Raw MediaInfo output is not necessary for sources and the relevant information can be organized into a simple and neat form found [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=177]here[/url]. Please note that the site automatically adds this empty description template when you select DVDR as your upload type so you can fill in the details then or paste your own completed description over top of the template.\r\n\r\nThis information can be found by looking through the disc itself and using [url=https://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/]MediaInfo[/url]. The size for a DVD5 is 4.37 GB or less, while for a DVD9 is more than 4.37 GB but usually less than 7.95 GB. If you can work out which edition of a film your DVDR came from then you may be able to find more information on sites like: [url=https://www.dvdbeaver.com/]https://www.dvdbeaver.com/[/url] or [url=https://www.dvdcompare.net/]https://www.dvdcompare.net/[/url].\r\n\r\nHow to determine the DVD format: [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=99]Guide to Anamorphic Widescreen DVDs[/url].\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][i]A model example of a great DVDR description.[/i]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/BD4Wk.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Untouched Blu-ray/HD-DVD Description[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][list=circle]\r\n[*] Download & Install [url=https://www.videohelp.com/software/BDInfo]BDInfo[/url].\r\n[*] Click the 'Browse' button and select the BD-ROM drive letter of your Blu-ray disc or mounted .ISO image. You may also select a folder containing a Blu-ray disc layout.\r\n[*] Perform a full bitrate scan by clicking the 'Scan Bitrates' button.

    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Overview[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[br /]\r\n[list=circle]\r\n[*] The most common display aspect ratio standards are 1.33:1(4:3), used with VHS on 20[sup]th[/sup] century standard definition CRT televisions or 1.78:1 (16:9), used with modern high definition and widescreen LCD displays. \r\n\r\n[*] Standard aspect ratios for film are 1.85:1 or 2.35:1\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nCommon methods of conversion include:\r\n\r\n[indent][list=circle]\r\n[*] Enlarging the original image by the same factor in both directions to fill the display and cutting off any excess picture information. This is commonly known as 'zooming and cropping' or pan and scanning'.\r\n\r\n[*] Adding horizontal mattes (letterboxing) or vertical mattes (pillarboxing) to retain the original film aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n[*] Stretching the image to fill the display through scaling by different factors in both directions. This leads to distortion of the picture and should be avoided if at all possible.\r\n[/list][/indent]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, DVDs became popular just prior to the switch from the older 4:3 display standard to the modern 16:9. This led to some confusion and multiple standards, especially with older DVD releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Anamorphic vs. Non-anamorphic[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent][list=circle]\r\n[*] Non-anamorphic (letterboxed) sources use hard-coded black bars to create frames that display a 4:3 picture. As the film's aspect ratio increases, more and more of the scan lines are devoted to the black letterbox bars at the top and bottom of the video frame instead of reproducing picture information. This reduces the amount of picture detail that can be displayed. Up to 33% of the data can be storing black pixels rather then actual video information.\r\n\r\n[*] An anamorphic source has little to no hard coded black bars, and works stretching the image vertically to create the 4:3 aspect ratio instead. This data is digitally processed by the display device. A 4:3 display will combine horizontal rows and add letterboxing bars. A 16:9 display stretches the original square pixels into rectangles, restoring the original aspect ratio without loosing any resolution.\r\n\r\n[*] Generally on a computer, the raw source will play in a window and only be adjusted when in fullscreen. If there are bars when viewed in a window, it is likely a non-anamorphic source.\r\n[/list][/indent]\r\n[br /]\r\n[center]\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/vt0Z3.png[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/q86qr.png[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/lZY9x.png[/IMG]\r\n[/center]",

This can take a moment to process.\r\n[*] Choose a good frame with little blurring. Ensure it is a source frame (ffinfo will tag it as \"source\") and save the image; click [b]Video -> Save image as...[/b].\r\n[*] Ensure the file type is set to [b]Portable Network Graphics (*.png)[/b] and click save.\r\n[*] Next, press the right arrow key once to shift to the same frame from the encode and repeat the saving process. If using a blu-ray source, it is recommended to only use frames marked as 'B' (in the upper right corner) for the encode screenshots. It is also a good idea to save screenshots as [b]source#.png[/b] and [b]encode#.png[/b] where [b]#[/b] is a different number for each set being compared. This makes it easy to remember which images are which and makes uploading easier as well.\r\n[*] Now all you need to do is upload these images to your favourite image host. We recommend [url=https://screenshotcomparison.com/]Screenshot Comparison[/url], [url=https://www.imagebam.com/]ImageBam[/url], [url=https://imgbox.com/]ImgBox[/url] or [url=https://imageshack.us/]ImageShack[/url] as hosts which will not resize high definition images.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nThe script takes your source file and the encoded file and interleaves them together displaying each frame of the video stream twice. The ffinfo option displays various technical information about each frame and spline36resize is used to display the video at the correct aspect ratio to enable accurate screenshots.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]Many thanks to Otra, OnkelLars, guccimane for various info that forms part of this guide.[/i]",

    "title": "Port Forwarding",
    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What is port forwarding?[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, port forwarding is opening a port or range of ports on a firewall to allow unsolicited external connections.\r\n\r\nIn almost all cases standard consumer routers and modems (the equipment you connect to for internet access) ship with a firewall. This firewall is generally configured to allow all outgoing connections (you requesting a web page, for example) but to drop all unsolicited incoming connections, think any computer trying to connect to you without you asking first.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is good. It prevents people being able to attack your computer and is a nice solution to the problem of [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_background_noise]internet background noise[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Why should I forward a port?[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when it comes to the bittorrent protocol, this behaviour does not help in sharing files very well.\r\n\r\nWhen you add a torrent file to your client it connects to TehConnection and retrieves a list of IP addresses which currently have the file you are after. Your PC then connects to as many of those IP addresses as it can to download the file.\r\n\r\nIf one of those addresses does not have an open port then when you try to connect the firewall will most likely drop the connection and you will not be able to download from that IP address.\r\n\r\nPossibly worse than not being able to download from others is the frustration of not being able to seed. You may find that without an open port you may have many torrents seeding in your client but not seeding anything. This is because when others try to connect to your IP address they are rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]How do I forward a port?[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\nLuckily many people have asked that question before. So many, in fact, that there is a website dedicated specifically to guides on how to forward ports on almost all consumer routers. The fastest way to learn how to forward a port is to go to [url=https://portforward.com/]this website[/url] and search for your model of modem or router.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What if I still have issues?[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\nThe best way to get assistance is to ask your fellow TehConnection members. We all have an interest in you being able to download and upload.\r\n\r\nFirst, search the forums for port forward questions, if there is nothing helpful already asked then start a new topic in the [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewforum&forumid=16]Help[/url] forum. Remember to include relevant details including the make and model of your router or modem and specifically what seems not to work.",

    "title": "Warnings",
    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What is a Warning?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA warning is exactly what its name suggests. It is a message that you have failed to adhere to our site's rules and is a signal that the identified behaviour needs to stop. A warning will not prevent you doing anything on site but can be accompanied by disablement of certain site privileges depending on the severity of the offence.\r\n\r\nWhen you receive a warning you will also receive a private message from the issuing staff member with an explanation of how long your warning will last and the reason you have been warned.\r\n\r\nA user with a warning is designated by an image next to their username ([img]https://static.tehconnection.eu/common/symbols/warned.png[/img]).\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Why Would I Receive a Warning?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons for which you could receive a warning. Violating the spirit of something in our [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=94]site manifesto[/url] will in most cases result in a warning at the very least. Other ways in which you can receive a warning include breaking one of the [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=88]site rules[/url], insulting or personally attacking other members of this site or making a nuisance of yourself either on site or in IRC.\r\n\r\nOften accompanying a warning will be a restriction of certain site privileges; if you are warned for repeated upload rule violations you may find your upload privileges restricted for some time.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]How Long Does a Warning Last?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nWarnings can last from a single week up to eight weeks. The length of a warning will be determined by the staff member responsible for issuing it. Restriction of site privileges has no set length and is up to the particular staff members' discretion.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What Do I Do if I Feel Unfairly Targeted?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nIf, for any reason, you feel your warning was unfair; please, in the first instance contact the staff member who issued it via private message. Explain in a calm, civil manner why you think it was unfair and/or ask for clarification. If you are still dissatisfied then join our site support channel in IRC (#TC.Support) and ask for further consideration of your case. Ultimately, however, a warning is issued and upheld by the issuing staff member.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What Not to Do if You Receive a Warning.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nDo not continue to do whatever it was you were warned for. Repeatedly ignoring rules and warnings will result in account disablement.\r\n\r\nDo not under any circumstances complain in the forums or main IRC channel. This will likely only serve to lengthen your warning.\r\n\r\nDo not contact any other staff member than the one who issued your warning. Any warnings issued are the responsibility of the issuing staff member.",

Seriously, this helps more than most people realise.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Uploading[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nSecond only to seeding content already on site is providing new content to the site. Make sure you read our uploading rules but uploading films can only help the site. There are many places to source films to upload. Think your local library, films from elsewhere on the internet etc...\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Encoding[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nNot so much of a dark art as it used to be; we have a very talented group of encoders on site who have contributed greatly in terms of content as well as teaching others how to encode their DVDs and Blu-ray discs. Take a look at our guides and tutorials board and the Wiki for a list of encoding tutorials and upload something that no other site has.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Donating[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nWithout donations this site stops running. Literally, the server hosts unplug it. If you have a few dollars spare during the month consider donating to keep this community running. To read more about donating click [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=81]here[/url] or the [b]Donate![/b] link at the top of any page.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]The Studio[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe Studio is a forum board specifically dedicated to users contributing code, scripts, and style sheets.

    "body": "[i][url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php]Wiki Home[/url][/i]\r\n\r\n\r\nTehConnection has a comprehensive request system in place which allows you to request pretty much any permitted film in any allowed format. This is a quick tutorial to guide members who are new to the requests system.\r\n\r\nFirst of all you will need to head to the request page. This can be achieved in one of two ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]1.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[indent]Either click on 'requests' in the top set of buttons on site.[/indent]\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/uHhyM.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]2.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[indent]Alternatively you can click the 'Torrent' menu on any film page. At the bottom of this menu is a 'Request Format' option. This is useful if you know a version of the film is on site already as it skips some of the steps in the request process.\r\n\r\nChoosing the second option will land you directly on a new request page. You can skip down to step five.[/indent]\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/hXjZA.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]3.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[indent]Clicking the 'requests' button will take you to the main request page. From here you need to click the '[New Request]' link.[/indent]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]4.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[indent]Your next step is to open a new tab/page and head to https://imdb.com/ and search for the film you are after. Once on the film page on IMDb copy the page URL, paste it into the IMDb text box and click 'Fetch from IMDb'. This will populate the fields we need from IMDb.[/indent]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]5.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[indent]Now select from the four drop down boxes what format of the film you would like uploaded. Your options are explained in our TehConnection Movie Formats article.[/indent]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]6.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[indent]After selecting which format you would like to have uploaded you can optionally enter a bounty as reward for the uploader who is able to successfully fill your request.\r\n\r\nEvery request incurs a minimum bounty of two hundred fifty ([b]250[/b]) MiB from the requester's upload statistics. This can bee seen from your site profile as the amount of ratio spent on requests.[/indent]\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/J7OPD.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[indent][b]Note[/b]: When calculating a custom bounty to add to a request; make sure to keep in mind that 1 GiB is 1024 MiB. This can be confusing if you were to enter 1000 MB thinking it to be equal to a GiB. This is a common confusion (more detailed information on [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix]Wikipedia[/url]) and has been avoided by our inclusion of a MB/GB check box.\r\n\r\n50% of each bounty is taken by the site as a form of 'tax', this is to make sure there is some balance to the site economy. The tax is taken and cannot be refunded at all so be careful.[/indent]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]7.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[indent]Last but not least we have the description text box. This can be a very important field depending on what you are after.\r\n\r\nCommon examples of information in this field include:\r\n[list=circle]\r\n[*]A specific Scene release of a film, put the Scene release name in that box.\r\n[*]A specific company's release of a DVD (such as Criterion or Tartan).\r\n[*]A link to where it is possible to buy the movie.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nAnything (within reason) that you require that hasn't already been specified can be put into this field.[/indent]",

    "title": "CODECs & Containers Explained",
    "body": "There can often be some confusion when one is new to downloading video and encounters terms such as CODEC, x264, Matroska or container. This article aims to explain all of those terms and remove any confusion.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we need a place to start. When talking about digital video files there are two main components that are important to understand. The [i]CODEC[/i] used in the file and the files [i]container[/i]. An easy way to think about the differences between these components is to imagine a video file as a sandwich. The CODEC is the filling and the container is the bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What is a CODEC?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nCODEC is a portmanteau of 'compressor-decompressor', in this sense it refers to what software was used to compress the original video stream into what it is now as well as what software can be used to decompress the file's data and allow playback. More precisely, a CODEC is a mathematical algorithm used to compress digital audio and video for transmission and decompress it for playback.\r\n\r\nThe most common CODECs you will encounter on TehConnection are Xvid and x264. A full list of CODECs allowed is available below and includes explanations.\r\n\r\n[b]DivX[/b] - DivX, in its earliest form, originated from a reverse engineered version of the Microsoft MPEG-4 Version 3 video CODEC. Later, it was substantially re-written and improved. After a falling out between the original developers the project was forked and Xvid was born.\r\n\r\n[b]Xvid[/b] - Xvid (formerly XviD) is the most common CODEC in use today with regard to file sharing. It is open source and highly efficient when used to compress video streams for transport over the internet.\r\n\r\n[b]x264[/b] - x264 is a free and open source implementation of the MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 standard which is the current standard used in Blu-ray disc authoring. This CODEC is highly efficient and is the best choice for encoding standard and high definition content when considering quality.\r\n\r\n[b]MPEG-2[/b] - MPEG-2 is the standard and encoder introduced before MPEG-4 and is used in DVDs and a lot of HDTV broadcasts.\r\n\r\n [indent]- TS: Stands for Transport Stream and is the format designed for television broadcast.\r\n - PS: Stands for Program Stream and is the standard designed for storage of digital media such as DVDs.[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]VC-1[/b] - VC-1 is Microsoft's newest video CODEC and has been adopted as a standard for Blu-ray discs.\r\n\r\n[b]AVC[/b] - AVC is the other standard adopted as a Blu-ray disc format. It is the official offering of the MPEG & ITU groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also important to make a distinction here between CODECs and standards. A CODEC is a piece of software that is used to compress or decompress a video stream. A standard is a set of (usually) industry accepted guidelines on what a CODEC must do. A good analogy is imagining a standard as a basic blueprint and a CODEC is the actual building the blueprint describes.\r\n\r\nThere are often misunderstandings relating to the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video standards and the x264 CODEC. Often you will see people label a file with 'h.264' and while that is not strictly incorrect; it is much more useful to label it with which CODEC was used during encoding and is what we do at TehConnection.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What is a Container?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA container, as mentioned above, can be imagined as the bread part of a sandwich. It is what takes the interesting stuff and keeps it together an a (mostly, depending on your eating ability) manageable format.\r\n\r\nThe container will often determine the file extension of a particular video file. For example, a file wrapped in the Audio/Video interleave container will have the .avi extension. The two most common containers you will encounter on TehConnection are Matroska and Audio/Video Interleave.\r\n\r\nMatroska is a new, open source, container format with the file extension .mkv. This new container is under active development and supports many new features. As such, it is the container format used for high definition media as well as higher quality standard definition content.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio/Video Interleave, best known as AVI because of its file extension (.avi). This format was devloped by Microsoft in 1992. Because of its age there are many features and requirements of newer CODECs that it is unable to fill and as such is only permitted to contain MPEG-4 ASP (Xvid/DivX) at TehConnection.\r\n\r\nDVDR (PAL/NTSC) (MPEG-2) This container is a proprietary format adapted from the MPEG-2 standard. It is specifically designed to contain DVD compliant data and as such any video stream that does not conform to the requirements cannot be compressed.\r\n\r\nOgg\r\n\r\nBlu-ray\r\n\r\nHD-DVD\r\n\r\nTS (MPEG-2)",

Before making a request, double check whether what you are after is already on the site and/or if a request already exists.\r\n\r\n2. You should put in any details about the request (e.g. CODEC) when you submit it, or explicitly state that you don't mind about any particular criterion. This will mean that your request will be filled to your satisfaction.\r\n\r\n3. You should not post your request to the forums or on IRC, asking people either to add bounty or to fill the request. Simply making the request will suffice.\r\n\r\n4. You should try to give as much information as possible about the request, as that will help potential fillers or co-requesters.\r\n\r\n5. You should not unfill a request if it meets the criteria stated, even if you forgot to state some when you originally posted the request. If it is what you said you wanted but not what you actually wanted, too bad. Learn for next time.\r\n\r\n6. You should not use the request system as a way to transfer upload credit to another member of the site.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Filling a Request[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n1. If you see a request for which a torrent is already on the site, it is considered good courtesy to notify the uploader of that torrent, rather than filling the request and claiming the bounty yourself. If the uploader then does not respond after a suitable period of time, feel free to fill it.\r\n\r\n2. You should not ask for extra bounty before you fill a request. Bounty is not a right, it is a gift.\r\n\r\n3. You should not fill a request with a torrent that does not meet the stated criteria. If you are unsure about whether your torrent meets the stated criteria, contact either the person who made the request or a member of [url=https://tehconnection.eu/staff.php]staff[/url].",

    "title": "What is a Seedbox?",
    "body": "A seedbox is usually defined as a remote computer and usually attached to a high speed internet connection and used to seed torrents. These computers can be shared or private and can range from 10Mbit/s to 10Gbit/s connections. If you're considering a seedbox, consult our official [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=4599]seedbox recommendation thread[/url] for advice on providers.\r\n\r\nGenerally there are three \"types\" of seedbox available.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Dedicated Server[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis is a dedicated physical machine that is rented from a provider or reseller. As the machine is dedicated it is usually an 'assembly required' option as the user will have to configure the operating system, install the torrent client and any other required software. However, as the user has full control of the physical hardware, it can be used to the full potential. Windows based servers usually cost more due to the cost of the Microsoft license. \r\n\r\nWhen buying a dedicated server the physical hardware specifications should be considered, specifically RAM size, hard drive size and CPU speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]VPS[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA VPS is a Virtual Private Server and is a dedicated server that has been split virtually for clients. Like dedicated servers these virtual servers are rented out to clients. Also like a dedicated server configuration of the operating system will be necessary unless the provider supplies a pre-configured environment.\r\n\r\nWhen buying a VPS server the ammount of RAM allocated to your VPS should be considered. The burstable CPU speed also needs to be taken into account. [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server]More information about VPS's[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Slice/Shared[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis is becoming the most popular way to have access to a seedbox. A slice is generally just access to a torrent client running on server. Providers may allow access to a control panel or FTP access. But generally the client will have no other control of the server. This is preferred as no configuration is required.\r\n\r\nFor all types of seedbox, the three main metrics to be considered are:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Hard drive space (How many files you can store)\r\n[*]Network speed (How fast you can download/upload)\r\n[*]Bandwidth limits (How much data you can download/upload)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these metrics you should also consider the cost, support offered and, if you desire files from your seedbox at home, location and/or routing. Routing is important to ensure fast FTP/SFTP download speed.",

    "body": "When you don't have a movie in mind that you'd like to watch it can be extremely hard to select one. Luckily, there are several options to assist you in selecting a movie. Every movie page on TehConnection features a trailer, list of cast, as well as rating from various online critic sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Using TehConnection[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][url=https://tehconnection.eu/top10.php]Top 10[/url][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThe Top 10 page will allow you to view the Top 10 most active torrents within the passed day, week, and of all time. This is a great way to find popular movies that you may not have seen. From this same page you can also expand to view the top 100 or the 250.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][url=https://tehconnection.eu/torrents.php]Films[/url][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThe Films page contains various filters that enable you to sort the entire list of torrents on site. Click the up arrow image above the torrent listings to sort all torrents by the number of seeders. Another great way to find a popular movie that may be relevant to your current taste (action, comedy, etc...) is to simply click one or more of the genre icons and click the up arrow again to refresh the top seeded torrents. You can narrow down the genre even more by selecting one of the sub-genre options (indie, musical, etc...). Sorting by year, title, and IMDb ratin are all possible from the Films page too.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][url=https://tehconnection.eu/peoples.php]Peoples[/url][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThis is, by far, the most underutilised tool within TehConnection for finding a movie that you may enjoy!\r\n[br /]\r\n[indent]\r\n[i]\"The \"Peoples\" feature is something we've concocted here at TehConnection to help you get connected to the movies here on the site. We're all movie fans and one thing we can all recognize is wanting to discover new and awesome movies. We've all got favourite actors, directors and writers. Whether you're a Whedon-ite and want to see everything Joss Whedon's ever worked on, or if you're a fan of thrillers and want to see all the Hitchcock films, you'll enjoy the Peoples section.\r\n\r\nWe've all spent time wandering through imdb listings and looking at all the cool movies we could find, often cross-referencing with our favourite tracker and hoping to find an awesome movie to watch. So, we sat down and thought about it and decided that we could do that here, so we grab the cast, directors and writers from IMDb and create listings here. If you're a fan of Robin Williams, you'll want to see all his movies, so check out his Peoples page and see what you haven't already seen and get to watching.\"[/i]\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][url=https://tehconnection.eu/montage.php]Montages[/url][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nMontages are user created lists of movies that are related to a certain subject, genre, or series. On a montage page, all the movies listed in the montage will be listed in a grid with their corresponding cover art. This is a great way to find a movie that you may have enjoyed years back, or you can simply click a random one and read the description or watch the trailer. A great example of a montage is \"IMDb -- Top 50 Comedy Titles\". The 50 highest rated movies on IMDb have been aggregated into this list. There are many other montages other than Top 50/100/250. Some montages are created to list the top award winning films, and some are simply to list films that are relevant to a certain category (e.g. Documentary).\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][url=https://tehconnection.eu/reviews.php]Reviews[/url][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nOn the reviews page, you will find user-generated reviews on many movies.

If you're absolutely stuck on finding a movie, just ask! No matter where you are, people watch movies and almost always have something to say about them. Simply asking a friend \"Hey, what's a good movie to watch?\" can lead you to all sorts of new types of movies. Even asking on your favourite social networking website is bound to get some answer and maybe spark some debate.

    "title": "Port Forwarding A Beginner's Guide",
    "body": "[b]I (Elwood) did not write most of this.[/b]\r\n\r\nSo you've just learned how BitTorrent works but then after all your hard research you download stuff, wait to upload, and what? Nothing's uploading? Chances are, if you are behind a router, you need to do some portfwarding. This is what happens when on the torrent pages, you are listed as \u201cNot Connectable\u201d\r\n\r\n[b]\r\n1.How Routers Work\r\n2.Internal vs External IPs\r\n3.Static vs Dynamic IPs\r\n4.How Ports Work\r\n5.Putting it All together\r\n6.Now What?\r\n\r\n[/b]\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]How Routers Work[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nBefore we can get into all that good junk, I think it's best to explain just how routers work.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have multiple PCs under one roof...rather than have a modem for every single PC to connect to the internet, you have one modem, and one router. With the router every PC in the house can connect to the internet, using a wireless connection.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Internal vs External IPs[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe router has what's called an external IP address that \u201cmarks\u201d who you are. You, me, and everyone that's connected to the internet has an external IP \u2013 when you go to Google and do the \u201cWhat's my IP?\u201d thing \u2013 that's your external.\r\n\r\nHowever, only one IP address is assigned for one household (unless you pay for it assuming your ISP offers...unlikely), so what happens when 3 different PCs are under one router? Well, they all have the same external address, but each individual PC has an internal IP address.\r\n\r\nThe internal IP address identifies each computer on the network. It's normally something like 192.xxx.x.xxx. For example, my internal IP address last time I checked was 192.168.1.3. Don't worry, nobody can see your internal address unless they're on the same network as you.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Static vs Dynamic IPs[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nDon't worry, we're getting to the good stuff soon. But you need to know this info in order to understand how port forwarding works. This is pretty easy though.\r\n\r\nA dynamic IP address will change, most of the time randomly. This could apply to external or internal IPs, but for port forwarding you have to pay attention to the internal IP address. When does it change? It depends. Sometimes it'll change every time you reconnect, sometimes if you get rebooted...it just depends on the router.\r\n\r\nA static IP address never changes; you set it to a specific IP and it stays there until the router is either set back to factory defaults or you change it.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]How Ports Work[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nWhen a packet is sent to a computer \u2013 when information is sent to a computer that is \u2013 it travels through an open port. Your PC does this all the time without you even knowing! Common ports are used daily, for things like the internet, instant messaging, etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, it might be that your instant message client uses port 5555, and your IP is 987.654.321. When you are sending a message, the data is sent from 987.654.321:5555. The : designates the port number to be used.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of the ports on your connection are closed, unless you open them. This is all leading up to our next section...\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]But what IS port forwarding?[/b][/size][/color] \r\n\r\nWhy do I care? What does this have to do with my slow uploads!?\r\n\r\nWhen you don't have a port open for your BitTorrent client, it makes connecting to people extremely difficult. When your ports are not forwarded, you can send a request to connect to a peer, but you can't receive any.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nOk, let's say Bob, Sally, and Joe are all on a torrent. Bob is the only one that is connectable (ports forwarded). Sally sends a request to connect to Bob, which he can accept and they're fine. Joe does the same. However, Joe then sends a request to connect to Sally, but guess what? They aren't going to connect. Why? Because Sally can't receive any incoming connections.\r\n\r\nNow imagine if all three weren't connectable. Nobody would connect! People would be sending requests left and right, but nothing.\r\n\r\nSo if you've noticed lately that you aren't connecting to any leechers (or seeders), and there are a LOT OF BOTH, then you need to do some port forwarding. Opening your ports will also greatly help your upload /download speed itself.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]So how do I do that?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nWell first you need to set up a static internal IP, what we were talking about earlier. Why is this? Because in order to forward your ports you have to assign a \u201crule\u201d in your router settings to keep that port open. You assign the rule based on the internal IP \u2013 that way the router knows which PC it's talking about.\r\n\r\nHave you seen the problem yet? If you have a dynamic static IP, every time your dynamic IP changes you have to go into your router settings and change it. Again. Sounds annoying, doesn't it? But if you make your IP static, all will be resolved\r\n\r\nA link to making your IP static can be found here (yes, for Macs too and even xbox 360): https://www.portforward.com/networking/staticip.htm\r\n\r\nThose directions are real easy, just follow them and you'll be good.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]When you first set up your static IP, you WILL lose connection briefly. It's your router resetting itself. You SHOULD reconnect just fine in a bit...you only have problems if you won't reconnect at all.[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nOnce you've set up your static IP you need to pick a port to open up for your torrent client.\r\nCheck out the port authority (so to speak), IANA.org, and choose an unassigned port from 1 to 49151, or any port from 49152 to 65535.\r\nAssign your chosen port in your torrent client settings, and then assign a rule in your router for that port (for TCP and for UDP) for your static IP.\r\n\r\nDon't panic! I know that was no help. Portfoward.com has literally a guide for almost any router you can think of. Just go to https://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm , find your router, and then find your client in the list that pops up. 99% of the time those guides are very straight forward and simple.\r\n\r\nFirewall software, if you run it (either built-in to your OS, stand-alone 3rd party software, or included with your anti-virus) is very similar to what a router does. You'll need to go to your firewall settings and either open your chosen port (TCP and UDP), or simply set it to \"allow\" your torrent client to receive and send data/connections (this will let your client choose which port to open).\r\n\r\nA guide to several software firewalls (including XP's Windows Firewall) can be found here:\r\nhttps://portforward.com/english/routers/firewalling/routerindex.htm\r\n\r\nFor Mac:\r\n\r\nOSX 10.4 (Tiger)\r\n# Open System Prefs > Sharing > Firewall.\r\n# Click \"New.\"\r\n# In the \"Port Name\" pop-up menu, select Other, and fill in the settings as follows:\r\n* TCP Port Number(s): the port you chose.\r\n* Description: Transmission (or whatever your client name is)\r\n\r\nOSX 10.5 (Leopard)\r\n# Open System Prefs > Security > Firewall. Make sure \"Set access for specific services and applications\" is selected.\r\n# Click the \"Advanced\" button and select your torrent client from you Applications folder.\r\n# Make sure the pull down menu is set to \"Allow incoming connections\".\r\n\r\nOSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard)\r\n# Open System Prefs > Security > Firewall tab\r\n# Assuming that your firewall is running, click on \"Advanced...\"\r\n# Click on the \"+\" symbol beneath the list of applications and select your torrent client from the Applications folder. Make sure it is set to \"Allow Incoming connections\"\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Once that's done...[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nYou're done! Restart your client and you should be good! If you're not sure if it's working, go look at the peer list on one of the torrents you might be seeding/leeching \u2013 it will have \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d under connectable.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]The Most Common Reasons for the Port Forwarding Not Working:[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n1. No static IP\r\n2. Typo in the router settings\r\n3. Typo in the client settings\r\n4. Firewall not given permission\r\n5. Port scanner/checker website (including \u00b5Torrent's built-in checker) blocked by IP blocker (like Peer Block). This may falsely advise your port is not open just because that particular IP of that checker could not connect. Try several other port checker websites to verify.",

However if you have enabled the web interface it is the best way to configure ZNC.\r\n\r\nOnce you have logged into the web admin you will want to create a user to connect to the tehconnection irc server. Click add user and fill in the following fields:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Username - This is used to log into ZNC\r\n[*]Password - To log into ZNC\r\n[*]Allowed IPs - If you want to restrict access\r\n[*]Nickname - This is your IRC nickname\r\n[*]Alt. Nickname - In case that nick is unavailable\r\n[*]BindHost - If your machine has multiple IP addresses choose which address to bind to\r\n[*]Servers - Put \"irc.tehconnection.eu +7000\" for SSL otherwise \"irc.tehconnection.eu 6667\"\r\n[*]Modules - I suggest you tick the Nickserv and Perform modules\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Using ZNC[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nOnce you have created a user you need to log into ZNC. In mIRC add a new server using the address you told ZNC to listen on and the port you specified. Dont forget to add a + before the port if your using SSL. Then in the password field put your username then a colon then your pass. So for example if your username was b3n and the pass was h8e2h8 then you would put b3n:h8e2h8 as the server password.\r\n\r\nOnce you have connected to see the list of available commands msg the znc user with:\r\n\r\n[pre]/msg *znc help[/pre]\r\nAll commands are sent to the user *znc and each extra module has its own user. I suggest you setup the Nickserv and Perform modules with the following commands:\r\n\r\n[pre]\r\n/msg *perform add msg zooey auth [tehconnection username] [IRCkey]\r\n/msg *nickserv set [Nickserv password]\r\n[/pre]\r\nNow you can connect your ZNC bouncer to tehconnection irc with:\r\n\r\n[pre]/msg *znc connect[/pre]\r\nZNC has a lot more options and many different modules.

The Wikipedia article is an excellent in-depth article but the key item to take away is that bit depth is the measure of accuracy available for storing and displaying colour.\r\n\r\nAt the consumer level, the majority of digital media (including Blu-ray) and hardware today and for the foreseeable future will have the ability to display eight bits of colour information. This is because eight bits has been the de facto standard for a very long time. Eight bits of colour means that for each of the three primary colours (red, green & blue) there are two hundred fifty six (256) different shades of that colour. Combined they allow for twenty four (24) bits of colour depth to be displayed which is also the most common colour depth configuration of most operating systems.\r\n\r\nThe total possible number of colours able to be displayed with eight bit systems is 16,777,216 (256[sup]3[/sup]). A ten bit colour depth allows for one thousand twenty four (1024) shades for each primary colour and over a billion total possible shades; twelve bit has four thousand ninety six shades for each primary colour and over sixty eight billion possible colours, 1024[sup]3[/sup] and 4096[sup]3[/sup] respectively.\r\n\r\nTo give you some context, your average cinema will use (at least) a 2K but usually a 4K projector and show film with a twelve bit (ten bit for 3D) colour depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Why Do We Need 10 Bit Encodes?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nYou might ask that if all of our hardware and digital media is stored and transmitted with an eight bit colour depth, aren't we wasting our time encoding with a ten bit colour depth? This is a good question and something that currently has many incorrect or partially correct answers.\r\n\r\nTo answer this we need a little side information, most LCD panels ([url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TFT_LCD#Twisted_nematic_.28TN.29]TN panels[/url] to be precise) can only represent a colour depth of six bits (a mere sixty four shades for each primary colour) and under normal circumstances to the regular user this would look terrible. To work around this issue these panels use a trick named '[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither]dithering[/url]' to simulate a colour depth of eight bits. In simplified terms this means that the panel quickly alternates between the nearest of the available sixty four (six bit) shades to simulate more available colour depth. When done correctly, a six bit panel is able to create the illusion that it is capable of a higher colour depth than it actually is.\r\n\r\nThis trick can also be used to display high bit depth encodes on hardware and software only capable of eight bit output.\r\n\r\nThis still does not fully answer the original question, surely we could simply encode in eight bit and hard code that dithering to simulate a ten bit colour depth?\r\n\r\nThis is actually already the case, it is mainly used to prevent [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding]colour banding[/url]. The huge drawback with this hard coding is that the bit rate required to keep the dithering intact is disproportionately high and can result in much larger files.\r\n\r\nThis is where the true advantage of ten bit encoding reveals itself; we are able to use fewer bits to represent the same image even if the source is only eight bits. We end up with a double whammy with ten bit encoding, not only do we no longer need to hard code dithering but we can also increase our error tolerance. Losing one bit of information in an eight bit colour range is equivalent to three bits in a ten bit space. This means that the same quality can be perceived with a lower bit rate allowing encoders to achieve [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(data_compression)]transparency[/url] with smaller files.",

    "title": "Debian Server Configuration",
    "body": "Ask for help [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=1745]here[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\niptables\r\n \r\n Alrighty, this may be considered overkill by some but I like to run a tight ship. We're going to configure Debian's built in firewall to harden your server. You will need to know (write it down, it makes it wasy to remember) some key information for this next step. What services will your server be running that will require external access. For example a webserver or an IRC bouncer. Write the ports you need to keep open down and keep the list handy to make sure you don't forget something.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nLet's take a look at how iptables is configured already:\r\n \r\n # iptables -L\r\n \r\n Your output should look something like this:\r\n \r\n Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\r\n target     prot opt source               destination\r\n\r\n Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\r\n target     prot opt source               destination\r\n\r\n Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\r\n target     prot opt source               destination\r\n \r\nThis allows access from anything to anywhere an is the default for any Debian distribution. We should probly tighen that up a bit. There are several programs which assist in configuring iptables but they aren't really needed, it is very easy to do it yourself and you have a greater understanding of what is happening that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's create an iptables test file:\r\n\r\n# nano /etc/iptables.test.rules\r\n\r\nInto this file we'll enter some basic rules, the following should be copied verbatim. You'll get errors if you change anything:\r\n\r\n*filter\r\n\r\n# Allows all loopback (lo0) traffic and drop all traffic to 127/8 that doesn't use lo0\r\n-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\r\n-A INPUT ! -i lo -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j REJECT\r\n\r\n# Accepts all established inbound connections\r\n-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\r\n\r\n# Allows all outbound traffic\r\n# You could modify this to only allow certain traffic\r\n-A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom here on we need to think about wht the server will be doing. Will it only run a torrent client? Will it also run an IRC bouncer, FTP client, VPN, web server, nzb client? After we know what we're planning to allow (writing a list often helps) we can write our custom rules.\r\n\r\nThe rules follow a specific format which is easy enough after an explanation.\r\n\r\n-A INPUT - The 'chain' we're adding the rule to.\r\n-p tcp,udp,icmp,any - The protocol our traffic uses. Most often tcp is used.\r\n--dport 80 - the port that inbound traffic will target. In the case of a torrent client or IRC bouncer this port can be chosen by us and be anything (above 1024) that we like.\r\n-j ACCEPT - Whether we accept, reject or drop the traffic.\r\n\r\nWhen we put this together we can build a basic rule:\r\n\r\n-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\r\n\r\nThis rule will allow any tcp traffic destined for port 80 through the firewall; in other words it is necessary if you want to run a web server.\r\n\r\nThe rule for your torrent client will be the same except that the --dport argument will be different. You will need to replace '80' with the port number you plan to have your torrent client use. This is the seedbox version of port forwarding, what you do at home on your router.\r\n\r\nAt the end of your file you should add the following. It is very important that you add the reject all other inbound rule at the end or you will lock yourself out of the server.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Allow ping\r\n-A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT\r\n\r\n# Reject all other inbound - default deny unless explicitly allowed policy:\r\n-A INPUT -j REJECT\r\n-A FORWARD -j REJECT\r\n\r\nCOMMIT\r\n \r\nAfter you have written the rules you want and saved the file we can test it for real with the comand:\r\n\r\niptables-restore < /etc/iptables.test.rules\r\n\r\nNow take a look at the difference:\r\n\r\niptables -L\r\n\r\nThe output now should tell you that the ports you want open are and all others are now closed. Once you are happy with your configuration we should save it:\r\n\r\niptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\r\n\r\nAs it is now, you're protected and your rules are saved but if your server needs to reboot the rules will not be applied when the server is brought online. To make sure they are, we need to create a script:\r\n\r\nnano /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables\r\n\r\nAdd these lines to it:\r\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n/sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules\r\n\r\nThe file needs to be executable so change permissions:\r\n\r\nchmod  x /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables\r\n\r\nUnless you plan to use IPv6 I would suggest dropping all traffic. Most network providers are providing IPv6 network access and your server could very well be sending receiving things you do not know about.\r\n\r\nnano /etc/ip6tables.test.rules\r\n\r\n*filter\r\n\r\n# Drop all IPv6 input.\r\n\r\n-A INPUT -j DROP\r\n\r\n# Drop all IPv6 forward requests.\r\n\r\n-A FORWARD -j DROP\r\n\r\n# Drop all IPv6 outbound traffic.\r\n\r\n-A OUTPUT -j DROP\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMIT\r\n\r\nip6tables-restore < /etc/ip6tables.test.rules\r\n\r\nip6tables -vL\r\n\r\nip6tables-save > /etc/ip6tables.rules\r\n\r\nnano /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/ip6tables\r\n\r\n!#/bin/bash\r\n\r\n/sbin/ip6tables-restore < /etc/ip6tables.rules\r\n\r\nchmod  x /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/ip6tables\r\n\r\n[color=red]This guide is currently a work in progress.

Troubleshooting[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\nI need to credit various sources on the internet for giving me the knowledge I needed to write this. A few months ago I knew nothing about configuring a server and everything I have learned has been from these people/sources. Thanks go to naq, EmEyKeYwAy & scribe. I have also used Google and all of the software developers websites as well as lots of patient IRC dwellers' help.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Initial Configuration[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThis guide assumes you know a small amount about Linux and using the command line. Having said this nothing we will do is very hard and I will make every effort to explain each step.\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/278a4/1136bedscreenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\nI assume you will begin with a stock standard Debian server install but pretty much any version of Debian and its derivatives (Ubuntu etc...) will work just fine.\r\n\r\nThe principles of what I am doing will apply to any distribution of Linux although the commands and file locations will differ.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this guide you will have a server running the latest version of rTorrent with apache serving the latest version of rutorrent. I'll also provide instructions for compiling vsftpd, a light and secure FTP server. This guide will also cover some basic security measures you can take to harden your server against bots and hackers.\r\n\r\nYou will need root access to your server, be it at home or somewhere else. We will do most of what follows as root. Be careful as you can cause mayhem!\r\n\r\nI will assume you are interfacing with your seedbox using [url=https://www.putty.org/]PuTTY[/url] (above) or a similar SSH client. I have placed the commands you need to input in [ code] [ /code] tags. You can literally copy and paste these into PuTTY. Note that the '#' or '$' preceding each command are not part of the command. '#' denotes that the command is done as root and '$' means it is executed as a normal user. [color=red]Don't include '#' or '$' when you copy and paste![/color]\r\n\r\nIf a command has to be executed on its own I will give it a separate set of code tags but if multiple commands are lumped together you can assume they can be run at the same time or straight after one another.\r\n\r\n[i][color=red][b]Handy Hint[/b]:[/color] The default 'paste' command in PuTTY is right click. 'Ctrl   V' will not work.[/i]\r\n\r\nFirst off lets make sure we are up to date.[br]\r\n\r\n[code]# apt-get update[/code]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/fb08e/47d27dfascreenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/8c0b5/bc4a595screenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[quote]# apt-get upgrade[/quote]\r\nNext up we'll install the required packages for our compiling and installing what we need.\r\n\r\n[quote]apt-get install apache2.2-common apache2-utils autoconf automake autotools-dev binutils build-essential bzip2 ca-certificates comerr-dev cpp cpp-4.1 dpkg-dev file g   g  -4.1 gawk gcc gcc-4.1 libapache2-mod-php5 libapache2-mod-scgi libapr1 libaprutil1 libc6-dev libcurl3 libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat1 libidn11 libidn11-dev libkadm55 libkrb5-dev libmagic1 libncurses5-dev libneon26 libpcre3 libpq5 libsigc  -2.0-dev libsqlite0 libsqlite3-0 libssl-dev libssp0-dev libstdc  6-4.1-dev libsvn1 libtool libxml2 lynx m4 make mime-support ntp ntpdate openssl patch perl perl-modules php5 php5-cgi php5-common php5-sqlite pkg-config postfix postfix-mysql screen sqlite subversion sudo ucf zlib1g-dev[/quote]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/f726c/9f5e6d5screenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\nYou will need to agree to any dependancies these packages may have and depending on the server's connection to the internet installation may take several minutes.\r\n\r\nIf you have no users on your system you will need to create a new one to run rTorrent. A note on rTorrent and rutorrent; they are both designed as single user systems which means that if you are setting up a box to resell or even just to share you will need to either run multiple instances or rTorrent and rutorrent (one per user) or simply have everyone use the same instance and make use of rutorrent's labelling system.\r\n\r\nI believe the latter is better for conserving system resources but the downside is that each user will be able to see what the other is downloading and the WebUI can become quite cluttered depending on the number of users. I will provide a guide detailing how to configure a single user system which multiple users can use. If demand is high, I will add an example of how to setup a server running multiple instances of rTorrent and different versions of rutorrent for each user.\r\n\r\n[quote]# adduser USERNAME[/quote]\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/e7767/1a45008screenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\nYou will be asked for some random information about your user. You can add whatever information you'd like. Now we'll create the needed directories.\r\n\r\n[quote]# mkdir /home/USERNAME/downloads[/quote]\r\n[quote]# mkdir /home/USERNAME/watch[/quote]\r\n[quote]# mkdir /home/USERNAME/.rtorrent[/quote]\r\n[quote]# mkdir /home/USERNAME/.rtorrent/session[/quote]\r\n\r\nLets give the correct permissions to our user.\r\n\r\n[quote]# chown USERNAME:USERNAME -R /home/USERNAME/[/quote]\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/26e5d/7c36df7screenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\nYou're now ready to install rTorrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]libtorrent, rTorrent & xmlrpc-c[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nNow we will compile the latest versions of libtorrent and rTorrent. rTorrent can also make use of xmlrpc-c as well so we'll compile it too. I usually compile software in /usr/local/src/ but where you compile source is up to you.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]xmlrpc-c[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[quote]# cd /usr/local/src/[/quote]\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/bce5c/abb160cscreenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[quote]# mkdir xmlrpc-c[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd xmlrpc-c/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# svn co https://xmlrpc-c.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xmlrpc-c/stable[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd stable[/quote]\r\n[quote]# ./configure --disable-cplusplus[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make install[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd /usr/local/src/[/quote]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]libtorrent[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[quote]# svn co svn://rakshasa.no/libtorrent/trunk/libtorrent[/quote]\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/93e54/df2233f9screenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[quote]# cd libtorrent/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# ./autogen.sh[/quote]\r\n[quote]# ./configure[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make install[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd ..[/quote]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]rTorrent[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[quote]# svn co svn://rakshasa.no/libtorrent/trunk/rtorrent[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd rtorrent/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# ./autogen.sh[/quote]\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/1695f/cbdf023screenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[quote]# ./configure --with-xmlrpc-c[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make install[/quote]\r\nThese programs can take some time to compile depending on your hardware.\r\n\r\nAfter all that we should update some shared libraries:\r\n\r\n[quote]# nano /etc/ld.so.conf[/quote]\r\nAdd the text \"include /usr/local/lib/\" to the file (without the quotation marks) and save and exit. To save in nano is Ctrl   O and to exit is Ctrl   X.\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/808e3/40448190screenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\nUpdate the system libraries.\r\n\r\n[quote]# ldconfig[/quote]\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Assuming all went well you now have a brand new rTorrent installation. Lets configure it.\r\n\r\n[quote]# nano /home/USERNAME/.rtorrent.rc[/quote]\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/9c985/85f108escreenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\nThere are several dozen options you can play with in rTorrent. Take a look over [url=https://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/rtorrent/rtorrent.1.html]here[/url] for the full list. \r\n\r\nHere is an example rTorrent configuration file. You can copy and paste it into nano if you'd like.\r\n\r\n[quote]# SCGI Settings\r\n\r\nscgi_port = 127.0.0.1:[color=red]7001[/color]\r\n\r\n# General Settings\r\n\r\nbind = [color=red]SERVER.IP.ADDRESS[/color]\r\nip = [color=red]SERVER.IP.ADDRESS[/color]\r\nport_range = [color=red]60450-60460[/color]\r\nport_random = no\r\nencoding_list = UTF-8\r\ncheck_hash = no\r\ndirectory = /home/[color=red]USERNAME[/color]/downloads\r\nsession = /home/[color=red]USERNAME[/color]/.rtorrent/session\r\nencryption = allow_incoming,try_outgoing,enable_retry\r\npeer_exchange = no\r\nschedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start=/home/[color=red]USERNAME[/color]/watch/*.torrent\r\nschedule = low_diskspace,5,60,close_low_diskspace=500M\r\nschedule = untied_directory,5,5,stop_untied=\r\n\r\n# Throttle Settings\r\n\r\nupload_rate = 0\r\ndownload_rate = 0\r\nmin_peers = 1\r\nmax_peers = 256\r\nmin_peers_seed = 1\r\nmax_peers_seed = 256\r\nmax_uploads = 64\r\nmax_uploads_global = 64\r\nmax_downloads_global = 64\r\n\r\n# Tracker Related Settings\r\n\r\nenable_trackers = yes\r\nuse_udp_trackers = yes\r\ndht = disable\r\n\r\n# Extra Settings\r\n\r\n#schedule = tied_directory,5,5,start_tied=\r\n#schedule = untied_directory,5,5,close_untied=\r\n#on_start = link1,\"create_link=tied,,.started\"\r\n#on_stop = link1,\"delete_link=tied,,.started\"\r\n#on_finished = link1,\"create_link=tied,,.finished\"\r\n#on_erase = link1,\"delete_link=tied,,.finished\"\r\n#schedule = low_diskspace,5,60,close_low_diskspace=500M\r\n#schedule = ratio,60,60,\"stop_on_ratio=1020,9000M,9000\"\r\n#on_erase = rm_complete,\"execute=rm,-rf,--,$d.get_base_path=\"[/quote]\r\nThere are several options you will need to configure. They are marked in red. The other options listed can also be configured as you like. The port range you use is up to you but keep in mind that the default bittorrent port range is not permitted to be used on most trackers. Generally somewhere in between 49152 - 65535 will do for most private sites.\r\n\r\nThe text in 'Extra Settings' is commented out but there are some powerful commands you can add to rTorrent to customise it. Read more over at the author's [url=https://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/]site[/url].\r\n\r\nThe throttle settings are pretty much default and can be adjusted to suit your hardware and connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]rutorrent[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nNow we will install rutorrent, a WebUI to rTorrent. There are several different web user interfaces available for rTorrent but I prefer rutorrent. You can check out [url=https://www.wtorrent-project.org/trac/]wtorrent[/url], [url=https://code.google.com/p/rtgui/]rtgui[/url] and [url=https://code.google.com/p/ntorrent/]ntorrent[/url] but I won't offer support for them.\r\n\r\nNavigate to the directory that apache can see (the default is /var/www/) and grab the latest build of rutorrent.\r\n\r\n[quote]# cd /var/www/[/quote]\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/d36c4/e8a4ef8screenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[quote]# svn co https://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rtorrent[/quote]\r\n\r\nLets edit the rutorrent configuration file.\r\n\r\n[quote]# nano /var/www/rtorrent/config.php[/quote]\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/66827/3fdd9a4screenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\nEdit the line which includes RPC_TIME_OUT and change it to 15000. This simply cuts down on the number of messages which are logged to rutorrent about timeout requests (it can become annoying).\r\n\r\nNext, edit the line starting with $scgi_host and change it to the same port as you set in the rTorrent configuration file. It is very important these numbers are the same and that you remember this number for later when we configure apache.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Updating & Patching[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]libtorrent & rTorrent[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nIf a new release of rTorrent is released and you need/want to upgrade (make sure TehConnection has [url=https://tehconnection.eu/rules.php?p=clients]whitelisted[/url] it first!) all you need to do is navigate to the source directory and update:\r\n\r\n[quote]# cd /usr/local/src/libtorrent/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# svn update[/quote]\r\nThen follow the same steps as above to recompile and reinstall rTorrent (./autogen.sh, ./configure, make, make install, make clean...) Your settings and session data will not be erased as it is all saved in a different location.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]rutorrent[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nIf you ever need to update rutorrent you can simply issue these commands from the directory rutorrent is installed in (/var/www/rtorrent/):\r\n\r\n[quote]# svn update[/quote]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Patching rutorrent[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nAt times the developers and testers will find issues with rutorrent and issue a patch to correct it. These patches can often be useful and waiting for the next release takes a while. [url=https://stephenjungels.com/jungels.net/articles/diff-patch-ten-minutes.html]This page[/url] shows how to add patches to software in Linux.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]rutorrent Plugins[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThere are many plugins available for the rutorrent frontend which offer enhanced functionality. You can view these [url=https://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/wiki/Plugins]here[/url].\r\n\r\nI'll update this guide as I experiment with them and recommend the better ones. If you have any experience with any of these plugins please PM me and I'll add extra info.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]apache[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nNow we need to enable SCGI in apache. This is so rTorrent and rutorrent can communicate. There is a plugin for rutorrent which accomplishes this but I have not tested it and from what I have heard my method provides better performance for now.

Lets fix that.\r\n\r\n[quote]# chown USERNAME:USERNAME -R /home/USERNAME/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# chmod -R 777 /var/www/rtorrent/[/quote]\r\n\r\nOpen a new instance of PuTTY and login to your server as the user you created to run rTorrent.

You can take a look at the file as your user by simply typing:\r\n\r\n[quote]$ nano .rtorrent.rc[/quote]\r\nLets take a look at that new rutorrent installation.\r\n\r\nhttps://IP.ADDRESS.OF.YOUR.SERVER/rtorrent/ - If your host has given you a URL (some.server.net) then that will work as well.\r\n\r\nIf everything loads nicely then all has gone well.\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://pic.leech.it/i/c659b/d1f2baescreenshot.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Authentication[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nYou might have noticed that we were able to browse directly to the rutorrent page without having to enter any kind of password. Unfortunately rutorrent does not have any kind of authentication system. To protect our WebUI we will need to make apache ask for a password.\r\n\r\nOn top of this I have also decided that I will explain how to use ssl for communicating with apache (https). This is because the username and password will be sent in clear text and anyone sniffing your packets will be able to grab the credentials otherwise.\r\n\r\nFirst off, lets create ourselves a self-signed certificate. We need this to use encryption but unfortunately browsers will throw up exceptions to self-signed certificates. There is nothing wrong with them it is just that they cannot be verified by a third party Certificate Authority (CA). You would do well to not trust any self-signed certificates unless you trust the website owner. Since that owner is yourself we are going to be OK.\r\n\r\nGenerate a key for the Certificate Signing Request (CSR):\r\n\r\n[quote]# openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024[/quote]\r\nYou will need to enter a passphrase which cannot be shorter than four characters (ideally eight or more) that you must not forget. When we have finished every time you restart apache you will have to enter it.\r\n\r\nNow we'll use our new key to create the CSR proper:\r\n\r\n[quote]openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr[/quote]\r\nYou will be asked a lot of information and you can put whatever you'd like in the fields that follow.\r\n\r\nNow we'll create the certificate:\r\n\r\n[quote]openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt[/quote]\r\nAll we need to do now is to install the certificate and remove the other file.\r\n\r\n[quote]# mv server.crt /etc/ssl/certs/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# mv server.key /etc/ssl/private/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# rm server.csr[/quote]\r\nNow we have a certificate we can enable mod_ssl in apache:\r\n\r\n[quote]# cp /etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/[/quote]\r\nAll that is left now is to configure ssl, set a password for our rTorrent directory in apache and we'll be using rutorrent encrypted!\r\n\r\n[quote]# nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default[/quote]\r\n[quote]<VirtualHost *:[color=red]443[/color]>\r\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\r\n\r\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/\r\n\r\n        [color=red]SSLEngine on\r\n        SSLOptions  StrictRequire\r\n        SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt\r\n        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/server.key[/color]\r\n        <Directory />\r\n                Options FollowSymLinks\r\n                AllowOverride All\r\n        </Directory>\r\n        <Directory /var/www/>\r\n                Options FollowSymLinks\r\n                AllowOverride None\r\n                Order allow,deny\r\n                allow from all\r\n        </Directory>\r\n        [color=red]<Directory /var/www/rtorrent/>\r\n                Options FollowSymLinksIfOwnerMatch\r\n                AllowOverride None\r\n                Order allow,deny\r\n                allow from all\r\n                AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/private/.htpasswd\r\n                AuthGroupFile /dev/null\r\n                AuthName \"A Server Name\"\r\n                AuthType Basic\r\n                <Limit GET POST>\r\n                require user USERNAME\r\n                </Limit>\r\n        </Directory>[/color]\r\n...[/quote]\r\nThe file contines after the dots but all you need to edit is what is highlighted in red. Where you see 'USERNAME' you may pick any username you'd like. If you'd like multiple username/password pairs to be able to login then replace your desired username with 'valid-user' (without the quotation marks).\r\n\r\nLets create the password file and then reboot apache and see if its all running smoothly.\r\n\r\n[quote]# mkdir /etc/apache2/private[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd /etc/apache2/private[/quote]\r\n[quote]# htpasswd -c .htpasswd [color=red]USERNAME[/color][/quote]\r\n\r\nhtaccess will prompt you to enter and re-enter a password. If you want to add another user then enter the same command as before but don't type the \"-c\" part. That way you will simply add another user to the same file.\r\n\r\n[quote]# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart[/quote]\r\napache will ask you for your passkey which we created when we created the certificate. Now we'll browse to the new and improved encrypted version of your server.\r\n\r\nhttps://IP.ADDRESS.OF.YOUR.SERVER/rtorrent/\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]vnStat[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=https://humdi.net/vnstat/]vnStat[/url] is a handly little program which keeps a record of your bandwidth usage by the server. It works by monitoring the network interface and can display the statistics via the commandline even in realtime.\r\n\r\nThis is useful to us but for those who can't be bothered firing up PuTTY for something like this there is a useful little frontend you can install so you can monitor bandwidth from your browser.\r\n\r\nLets grab the source for vnStat and get it running and configured:\r\n\r\n[quote]# cd /usr/local/src/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# wget https://humdi.net/vnstat/vnstat-1.9.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n[quote]# tar -xzvf vnstat/vnstat-1.9.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd vnstat-1.9/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make install[/quote]\r\nNow we'll test that vnStat is fine and then start the daemon. Lets select the interface we want to monitor and create the database entry for it.\r\n\r\n[quote]# vnstat --iflist[/quote]\r\nMy output for that command is: \"Available interfaces: lo dummy0 eth0 tunl0 gre0\" Pretty much everytime eth0 is the one you'd want to monitor.\r\n\r\n[quote]# vnstat -u -i eth0[/quote]\r\nNow lets take a look at what our little friend can do:\r\n\r\n[quote]# vnstat -l[/quote]\r\nMake sure it runs OK then exit and we'll create the init.d script.\r\n\r\n[quote]# nano /etc/init.d/vnstat[/quote]\r\nPaste [url=https://humdi.net/vnstat/init.d/debian/vnstat]this[/url] into the file then save and exit. Make the file executable and update the rc.d.\r\n\r\n[quote]# chmod  x /etc/init.d/vnstat[/quote]\r\n[quote]# update-rc.d vnstat defaults[/quote]\r\nThe daemon is now running so we can grab the frontend and install it.\r\n\r\n[quote]# mkdir /var/www/vnstat/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd /var/www/vnstat/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# wget https://www.sqweek.com/sqweek/files/vnstat_php_frontend-1.4.1.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n[quote]# tar -xzvf vnstat_php_frontend-1.4.1.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd vnstat_php_frontend-1.4.1[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cp * /var/www/vnstat/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# rm vnstat_php_frontend-1.4.1.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n[quote]# rm -rmf vnstat_php_frontend-1.4.1[/quote]\r\nNow we have the files where they should be lets edit their config and test it out.\r\n\r\n[quote]# nano config.php[/quote]\r\nLook for the line that says:\r\n\r\n[quote]$vnstat_bin = ' ';[/quote]\r\nChange it to:\r\n\r\n[quote]$vnstat_bin = '/usr/bin/vnstat';[/quote]\r\nNow lets test it out: https://SERVER.ADDRESS/vnstat/\r\n\r\nIf you see some data on the page then all is well! You can edit the other PHP files if you don't want to have the other interfaces appear or if you want a different colour scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]vsftpd[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=https://vsftpd.beasts.org/]vsftpd[/url] is my favourite FTP daemon. It is light and secure and is able to provide encryption. Pretty much everything you could need. Remember that even during encrypted FTP sessions only the command channel is encrypted. The data channels remain unencrypted so anyone who is sniffing can see what is transferred. For the most secure possible session investigate rsync/sFTP over SSH. If you'd prefer another FTPd then you can also check out [url=https://www.pureftpd.org/]Pure-FTPd[/url] or [url=https://www.proftpd.org/]ProFTPD[/url].\r\n\r\nLets grab the vsftpd source.\r\n\r\n[quote]# cd /usr/local/src/[/quote]\r\n[quote]# wget ftp://vsftpd.beasts.org/users/cevans/vsftpd-2.2.1.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n[quote]# tar -xzvf vsftpd-2.2.1.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n[quote]# cd vsftpd-2.2.1.tar.gz[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make[/quote]\r\n[quote]# make install[/quote]\r\n\r\nRemove the standard configuration file\r\n\r\n[quote]# rm /etc/vsftpd.conf[/quote]\r\nReopen the file and paste this configuration to get a more standard configuration.\r\n\r\n[quote]# nano /etc/vsftpd.conf[/quote]\r\n[quote]listen_port=65497\r\nlisten=YES\r\n#listen_ipv6=YES\r\nanonymous_enable=NO\r\nlocal_enable=YES\r\nwrite_enable=YES\r\n#local_umask=022\r\n#anon_upload_enable=NO\r\n#anon_mkdir_write_enable=NO\r\ndirmessage_enable=YES\r\nxferlog_enable=YES\r\nconnect_from_port_20=YES\r\n#chown_uploads=YES\r\n#chown_username=whoever\r\n#xferlog_file=/var/log/vsftpd.log\r\n#xferlog_std_format=YES\r\n#idle_session_timeout=600\r\n#data_connection_timeout=120\r\nnopriv_user=admin\r\n#async_abor_enable=YES\r\n#ascii_upload_enable=YES\r\n#ascii_download_enable=YES\r\n#ftpd_banner=Welcome to blah FTP service.\r\n#deny_email_enable=YES\r\n# (default follows)\r\n#banned_email_file=/etc/vsftpd.banned_emails\r\nchroot_local_user=NO\r\nchroot_list_enable=YES\r\n# (default follows)\r\nchroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list \r\n#ls_recurse_enable=YES\r\n#\r\n#\r\n# Debian customization\r\nsecure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd\r\npam_service_name=vsftpd\r\npasv_min_port=65401\r\npasv_max_port=65410[/quote]\r\nYou can change the port if you'd like but most definitely don't use the standard FTP communication port.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Security[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]Most of this information can be found in other places but as I have time I will add it here; probably in different tutorials as this one is long enough already.\r\n\r\nTo Add:\r\n\r\nChanging the FTPd and SSHd port.\r\nAuthorized Keys.\r\nLimit number of SSHd connection attempts.\r\nLimit root login.\r\nConfiguring iptables.\r\nPortSentry (listen on 21 & 22 to see who tries to connect).\r\nrsync/sFTP over SSH (completely encrypted file transfer).[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Troubleshooting[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[b]Common Problems[/b]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]Coming soon...[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\nAsk for help [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=1745]here[/url].",

    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What is TehConnection's MediaInfo Parser?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\nOur wonderful developers have written [url=https://tehconnection.eu/logchecker.php]a parser[/url] which reads a MediaInfo log and displays all kinds of information about an encode in a format that is easy on human eyes. An example output is displayed bellow.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgbox.com/adlvSc8O.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThe parser also labels encodes that meet certain encoding settings with a green check mark and the green 'Yes' you see in the example parser output. This is intended to give people who are not very familiar with encoding a rough idea of what to think of the encoding settings used. It is, however, entirely automatic.\r\n\r\nSince every source is different, every encode needs different settings. As the parser cannot tell how the encode looks compared to the source the green check mark should not be considered more than a guideline and not a mark that the encode is perfect.\r\n\r\nFor more information on quality encodes, take a look at our [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=101]quality encode article[/url].\r\n\r\nIt is mandatory to provide an unedited MediaInfo log for every Xvid & x264 file uploaded to TehConnection.",

For simplicity's sake, download the dual x86/x64 installer.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]1. Media Player Classic Black Edition[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nClick on the link for the latest version, then on the next page download the installer, which will be inside a zip archive. Run the installer. All optional installation components can be disabled here if you wish. If your primary language is not english, leave \"Translations\" checked.\r\n\r\n[u]Note[/u]: Media Player Classic Black Edition is available in a 64-bit (x64) version. I would recommend not using it, because madVR is currently 32-bit only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]2. madVR[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nExtract the files from madVR.zip to [color=red]%programfiles%\\madVR[/color]. Then double-click [color=#069]install.bat[/color]. From there, you may delete all [color=#069].txt[/color] files as well as the [color=#069]madTestPatternSource[/color] folder if you do not wish to keep them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]3. Installing dslibdvdnav[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThere will be two folders inside the zip archive - Win32, and x64. Extract them both. Open the Win32 folder and run DVDNavigatorPathHack.exe:\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/wNfDSWy.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nA window will pop up. Click the Hack button, point it to the dslibdvdnav.ax in the Win32 folder, and then click open. And that's it. There's no OK button, the installation is silent and there's not even a confirmation that the install was successful. If you're on a 64-bit operating system, you'll want to repeat this process by running the DVDNavigatorPathHack.exe in the x64 folder and pointing it to the dslibdvdnav.ax in the x64 folder as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]4. Setting Up Media Player Classic Black Edition[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/bpuRHXb.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Media Player Classic Black Edition. Right-click on the window and select Options. From there, select [color=#069]Formats[/color] and choose which file types you would like to associate with Home Cinema.\r\n\r\nNext, go to the Output section. Under the DirectShow Video sub-section, change the renderer from EVR Custom Pres. to [color=red]madVR[/color].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]5. LAV Filters, TrueHD and DTS-HD Audio Setup and Configuration[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nRun the LAV FIlters Installer. Leave all installation options as default, but disable the creation of start menu shortcuts. After LAV Filters is installed, navigate to its installation folder. There will be two folders here: x86 and x64. Copy [color=#069]dtsdecoderdll.dll[/color] to each of these folders.\r\n\r\nNow, open Media Player Classic Black Edition. Select View --> Options, then click on External Filters. Select [color=red]LAV Video Decoder[/color] to add it to the list of External Filters. Do the same for [color=red]LAV Audio[/color] and [color=red]LAV Splitter[/color]. For each of these, change the radio button at the right of the window from [color=#069]Set merit[/color] to [color=#069]Prefer[/color].\r\n\r\n[u]Note[/u]: If you also encode video, you will probably have Haali Media Splitter (required for eac3to) installed. When Haali is installed, it will force itself to be used instead of LAV Splitter. To prevent this, add Haali Media Splitter to Home Cinema's list of external filters and tick the [color=red]Block[/color] radio button to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nNext, open the Control Panel and click on the Sound shortcut. From the new window that pops up, highlight the audio device you will be using and click the Porperties button. Another window will pop up. From here, click the Advanced tab. Under the \"Default Format\" section, there will be a [color=#069]dropdown box[/color] that lists every bit-depth and frequency combination that your audio device supports. Select the highest quality combination and Apply. Leave this window open for now.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/RytA42h.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nDouble-click on LAV Audio Decoder - a new window will open. If you have an S/PDIF audio setup, click on the Audio Settings tab. Under the [color=red]Bitstreaming[/color] section, check the box for every format your hardware is capable of bitstreaming. Next, under [color=orange]Output Formats[/color], disable all bit-depth options that your audio device does not support. This information can be found in the dropdown box from the window you left open from the previous step. As an example, 8-bit and 32-bit options were not listed in the dropdown box for my sound card, so I disabled 8-bit, 32-bit and 32-bit Floating-point options.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/fb8qq02.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, double-click LAV Splitter - a new window will open. Here you can set your preferred subtitle language as I have:\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/55ImvsJ.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor english-speaking users, the line [color=red]eng:eng|f;eng:off;*:eng[/color] will enable only forced english subtitles when english audio is present, and english subtitles when non-english audio is present.\r\n\r\n[u]Note[/u]: The LAV Filters/Splitter will eventually be included with Home Cinema once they have been fully developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]6. LAV Video Configuration[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nUnder[color=#069]External Filters[/color], double-click LAV Video Decoder. A new window will pop up with a series of options. Set everything exactly as it appears here:\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/eSZH4Zt.png[/img]\r\n\r\nSome notes on the above preferences:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]They are tweaked for maximum quality, but the requirements for this are fairly low. Essentially any dual-core or better processor, 2 GB of memory and an Nvidia (or AMD equivalent) video card with 1 GB of [color=orange]GDDR5[/color] memory will suffice.\r\n[*]The Hardware decoder [color=green]drop-down list[/color] has several options. If you have an Nvidia video card that isn't ancient, choose NVIDIA CUVID. If you have an AMD Radeon series 4000 card or newer, select DXVA copy-back. If CUVID and/or copy-back don't work, select DXVA native. If none of the above options work, select Intel QuickSync. And if QuickSync doesn't work or you just have a monster computer, you can set the hardware decoder to None.\r\n[*]If you experience problems when playing MPEG-2 video with LAV CUVID, return to the above options window and uncheck the MPEG-2 button. Then go to the Internal Filters section and re-check [color=#069]MPEG-2 Video (DXVA)[/color].\r\n[*]The [color=red]MPEG-4[/color] and [color=red]UHD (4k)[/color] options under Codecs for HW decoding should be disabled unless you have a [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PureVideo#Table_of_PureVideo_.28HD.29_GPUs]compatible Nvidia card[/url] - VP4 is required for MPEG-4 (Xvid), and VP5 is reuired for 4k.\r\n[*]YADIF deinterlacing is slower and lower-quality than hardware deinterlacing. Only use it if hardware deinterlacing doesn't work for you. Note that even with hardware acceleration disabled, madVR will still use your GPU for deinterlacing and IVTC.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]7. Maximizing madVR's Awesomeness[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nOpen an h.264/x264 .mkv file in Home Cinema. While it is playing, right-click on the video and select [color=red]Filters --> madVR Renderer[/color]. A new window will pop up -- click Edit Settings, which will open yet another window with several options to configure:\r\n\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Under [color=#069]devices --> (your display) --> properties[/color], ensure the color levels are set to [color=red]PC levels (0 - 255)[/color].\r\n\r\n\r\n[*]Under [color=#069]devices --> (your display) --> calibration[/color], click [color=red]disable calibration controls for this display[/color]. You do not need to use the yCMS or 3DLUT option; they will only calibrate your display for video playback, and it is best to calibrate your display externally for everything. For this I recommend either a hardware colorometer (Eye-One, Huey Pro, Spyder3, etc) or the calibration disc your display may have come with. If you have already calibrated your display, check [color=red]this display is already calibrated[/color]. \r\n\r\n\r\n[*]While the video you opened is playing, switch from windowed to fullscreen. If you notice a difference in gamma brightness (blacks appear as dark grey), you'll also want to check \"disable GPU gamma ramps\".\r\n\r\n\r\n[*]Open your display's Advanced settings (in Windows 7, right-click your desktop --> Screen Resolution. In the window that opens, click [color=#069]Advanced settings[/color]) and click the Monitor tab. Click the [color=#069]Screen refresh rate[/color] dropdown box and take note of every option that doesn't include the word [color=red]interlaced[/color]:\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/UliDX.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, return to madVR's settings and go to [color=#069]devices --> (your display) --> display modes[/color]. In the [color=#069]list all display modes madVR may switch to[/color] box, you'll want to list several values. To find these values, take the vertical number from your display devices resolution and add the letter p, followed by one of the refresh rate options you found earlier. For me, I am using a monitor with a display resolution of [color=#069]1920x1080[/color] and my refresh rate options are [color=#069]50 Hz[/color], [color=#069]59 Hz[/color] and [color=#069]60 Hz[/color]. So I need to add the following values to madVR:\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/ERFxm.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, make sure the [color=#069]restore original display mode when media player closes[/color] option is checked. Properly setting up the [color=#069]display modes[/color] section will allow madVR to adjust your display's refresh rate based on the framerate of the video you are watching. This eliminates playback jitter on any video with a framerate that does not divide evenly into your display's default refresh rate. Probably the most common example of this would be PAL movies played in an NTSC region (and vice-versa).\r\n\r\n\r\n[*]If your screen has a fixed refresh rate or your screen's refresh rate options simply won't work here, consider enabling [color=#069]smooth motion frame rate conversion[/color], located under rendering --> smooth motion. smooth motion uses interpolation and blending to force smooth playback on any refresh rate. Take note that this does increase the load on your video card, and works best when playing low-framerate video on higher refresh rate screens.\r\n\r\nAlso note that automatic refresh rate switching and frame rate conversion make ReClock unnecessary in all scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*]Under [color=#069]processing --> decoding[/color], uncheck all three options.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*]Under [color=#069]scaling algorithms[/color], select the highestquality option(s) that gives you smooth playback. The following chart can be used as a reference for deciding which scaling algorithms to use:\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/HLv1qmj.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n(AR) stands for \"activate anti-ringing filter,\" and (LL) stands for \"scale in linear light.\" Also note that while 4-tap and 8-tap options are available for Jinc scaling, they are generally viewed as placebos and shouldn't be used unless you spent several hundred dollars on your video card. Jinc scaling itself is very gpu-intensive and requires a video card with no less 1 GB of GDDR5 memory. But even with mid-range hardware, smooth playback with Jinc scaling can be difficult to achieve. If you are experiencing problems with video playback when using Jinc scaling, change the following settings:\r\n\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]From LAV Video Decoder's settings, set the [color=green]Hardware Decoder[/color] to None (madVR will still use GPU-based deinterlacing and IVTC, which happens to be better than doing so with DXVA). \r\n[*]From madVR's settings go to rendering --> general settings and make sure automatic fullscreen exclusive mode is enabled as well as disabling desktop composition when media player is fullscreen.\r\n[*]Still from madVR, go to rendering --> exclusive mode settings and make sure the number of frames presented in advance is set to 4.\r\n[*]Leave the anti-ringing filter enabled. Jinc upscaling produces so little ringing that disabling the anti-ringing filter will not actually alleviate any GPU bottleneck.[/list]\r\n\r\nTest the above changes by playing a video that is has a smaller resolution than your computer's screen. Make sure the video is played in fullscreen mode so scaling is initialized, and observe how smooth playback is. If playback is smooth then you can keep your scaling settings as they are. If playback is not smooth, you will have to switch from Jinc to a less demanding scaling algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis is where madVR separates itself from EVR, which is Home Cinema's default as well as the default for Vista/7. EVR never uses a resizing algorithm better than Catmull-Rom, which is one of the lower-quality options available in madVR. Also note that if you play 1080p content back on a 1080p screen, madVR will automatically switch the resizing algorithm to Nearest Neighbor due to scaling not being required if the video and screen are the same resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*]Under rendering --> general settings, everything that your operating system supports should be checked. Only check [color=red]use managed upload textures[/color] if you're using Windows XP. Checking [color=#069]enable windowed overlay[/color] will improve playback smoothness while in windowed mode, but only if you're on Windows 7 or 8. Checking [color=green]disable desktop composition[/color] will free video card resources by disabling Aero (window border transparency) during video playback. The [color=purple]last two options[/color] should only be checked if your video card supports DirectX 11. These settings improve madVR's responsiveness when switching from windowed to fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/OQy9pDR.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[*]If you are still unable to get smooth video playback with madVR, try experimenting with some of the settings under rendering --> trade quality for performance.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith that done, anything you play in Media Player Classic Black Edition will be played back at the absolute highest level of quality. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nFeel free to take a few minutes to explore the rest of the settings. I personally changed the default subtitle font to Segoe UI, one of many [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif]Serif[/url] fonts that will reveal when people have made lazy mistakes creating the subtitle files.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][i]Many thanks to echohead for this guide.\r\nDiscuss or ask for help [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=3266]here[/url].[/i][/size]",

    "body": "[size=4][i]Many thanks to neebs for this guide.\r\nDiscuss or ask for help [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?page=1&action=viewthread&threadid=3826]here[/url].[/i][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Required Software[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [url=https://handbrake.fr/]Handbrake[/url]\r\n[*] [url=https://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/]MKVToolnix[/url]\r\n[*]D-Subtitler or a Windows Virtual Machine and SubRip\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]1. Preparing Handbrake and Your Source[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will cover how to encode DVDs using the x264 codec in the highest possible quality on Mac OS X. If you are encoding from a physical copy of the DVD, it is suggested that you rip the DVD to your hard drive first using a utility such as MacTheRipper or RipIt. Once you have the VIDEO_TS folder or an ISO of the DVD, open Handbrake. First of all, make sure to open the activity window as it is necessary for test encodes.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/ElcMr.png[/img]\r\n\r\nNow, to load your DVD, click \"Source\" in the top left corner of the screen. Once it has opened, be sure to select the VIDEO_TS folder or .ISO file.\r\n\r\nHandbrake should automatically open a window with a frame from the movie and the picture settings window. If it does not, click Picture Settings and Preview Window at the top right of Handbrake. Now, handbrake's autocrop feature is pretty good, but at times it will still make mistakes, it is always a good idea to skip through the preview images and make sure the cropping settings are correct. Leave Anamorphic set to Strict.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/pmY1r.png[/img]\r\n\r\nContinue to open the filters tab. Your DVD is most likely telecined to play on Standard Definition Television at 60hz. Meaning that the original framerate of 24fps is converted to 29.97fps while preserving runtime. Change detelecine to Default and on the preview window click live preview. Pay close attention for any \"teeth\" or jagged edges that are a sign of interlacing. If you can see the teeth, it is especially visible in movement, first begin by setting the Decomb filter to Default and once again testing via the Live Preview to see if it helps any. If it does not, and you believe your DVD to be interlaced rather than simply Telecined, change Decomb to Deinterlace and select the Slower option. Hopefully now your troubles are solved and we may move onto further preparation.\r\n\r\nReturn to the main Handbrake window. Under the format Option, select MKV file. Make sure the x264 Video Codec is selected, that the framerate is \"Same as Source\" and finally that you have Constant Quality checked for Quality. It does not matter where the slider currently sits, we will come back to that soon. It should look something like this:\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/kgqBQ.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAdvance to the audio tab. Choose the main audio track as Track 1 and select AC3 Passthru for the codec. \r\n\r\nIf there is an Audio Commentary track which you would like to include, choose it from the from the dropdown box in the second audio track position. For a codec choose AAC (faac) and select 96kbps for a bitrate.\r\n\r\nFor the subtitles tab, even if you are encoding a foreign film which necessitates English subtitles, select \"None\". We will focus on subtitles at the end of this guide.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the Advanced tab, what separates all of the terrible encodes you find on Demonoid from a high quality encode. We are setting this up for our test encodes, so please make your Advanced tab match the image below exactly.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/qTMsK.png[/img]\r\n\r\nIt would be a good idea to save these settings as a preset under \"Test\" or something similar. Finally, make sure the chapters Marker is checked to create chapters in your encode.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]2. Test Encodes[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nMaking sure you have your Activity Window open, return to the main Video tab of handbrake. Set the Constant Quality slider to in between 17 and 19. Now choose Frames from the Source option and select around 4000 frames from the middle of the movie. This will make sure that the encoder only encodes a small portion of the movie, making it easier to find the right settings to encode.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/BtMZH.png[/img]\r\n\r\nClick start and wait for the encode to finish. Now, open the Activity Window and you should see something very similar to this.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/Hs7NM.png[/img]\r\n\r\nFrom this we will be able to determine how many reference frames and b-frames are needed for this encode.\r\n\r\nFor b-frames, look at the following line:\r\n\r\n[pre]x264 [info]: consecutive B-frames:  1.1%  0.8%  2.5% 17.9% 19.8% 42.7%  8.3%  5.0%  1.4%  0.3%  0.0%  0.3%  0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  0.0%[/pre]\r\n\r\nThis lists how often 0-16 b-frames were encoded in succession, it is a good idea to use the b-frame setting that is the largest value with a percentage greater than 1.0%. In the case of this Scarface test, the ideal value is 8.\r\n\r\nFor Reference frames, look at the following line:\r\n\r\n[pre]x264 [info]: ref P L0: 25.8% 11.9% 11.7%  9.4%  6.4%  5.9%  4.6%  3.8%  3.2%  3.2%  2.7%  2.7%  2.3%  2.4%  2.0%  2.0%[/pre]\r\n\r\nIt lists how often the encoder used 0-16 reference frames, as you can see it used 16 2% of the time. It is a good idea to use the largest number above 1.0%, anything smaller only marginally helps compressibility and greatly hurts encoding time. In the case of this film, a reference frame setting of 16 is required.\r\n\r\nNow that you have the correct b-frame and reference frame settings, return to the Advanced tab in Handbrake and input whatever values you found from the x264 log.\r\n\r\nFinding the correct bitrate on OS X is an inexact science as there is no good frame-specific FFMPEG decoder available for the system. Compare the picture quality in your test encodes with the picture quality in the same scene of the source. Encode more test encodes, changing the RF value either higher or lower. You want the encoded video to be as close as possible to that of the source, with the highest possible RF value. Ideally this will yield a bitrate in the range of 1500kbps-2500kbps. Although both higher and lower bitrates are not outside of the realm of possibility. Once you have found an RF with which you are comfortable, you are ready to make the final encode.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]3. Final Encode[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nWith your RF setting chosen, and your b-frame and reference frame settings set, change the source selection from Frames to Chapters and ensure the entire movie is selected. Click Start. Wait for hours. And more hours. Honestly, you should either go to work or go to sleep, either way, this isn't gonna be done for a while.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]4. Subtitles[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nSadly, the only software available on Mac OS X to run OCR on subtitles is the terrible program D-Subtitler, which itself is outdated and must be run under Rosetta. I prefer to use SubRip either under Darwine or through a Virtual Machine. And as such, I will quote the SubRip tutorial of my esteemed colleague:\r\n\r\n[quote=echohead][u]5. Ripping Subtitles[/u]\r\n\r\n-Open SubRip. Click \"File --> Open  VOB(s)\". Then click \"Open Dir\". Here, again, you're looking for he VIDEO_TS folder. The VOB file you want is usually the one that coincides with the main movie. You'll know that you have the right one because you'll see something like this:\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/LQA9Q.png[/img]\r\n\r\nMany DVDs that only have one subtitle track will list the language as \"???\". On other DVDs there will be multiple subtitle tracks, each named for their language and (sometimes) for what audio/video stream they are for.\r\n\r\n-Now for the hard part. Click Start. SubRip has no way of \"knowing\" what each character in the subtitle file is, so you have to identify each one as subrip comes to it. Each character only has to be identified once though...for example, once you tell it that S is S, it will automatically identify every capital S in that movie.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/SoopD.png[/img]\r\n\r\n-After completely \"identifying\" all the subtitles, click \"Corrections --> Post OCR Correction:\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/rEjPG.png[/img]\r\n^make sure everything looks like this, then click OK.\r\n\r\n-Save the subtitle file. Let SubRip save it as Unicode if it asks. Don't save the character matrix.\r\n\r\n-Sometimes SubRip doesn't get everything right. Open the .srt file in notepad, copy all the text, and paste it into a word processor that has spellcheck. Check for misspelling, exra spaces before or after quotations, and the occasional extra or forgotten space between words.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]5. Muxing and Samples[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nOpen MKVMerge. Add the MKV created by Handbrake and, if need be, the SRT file created by SubRip/D-Subtitler. Choose an Output Filename, we suggest using a name in the style of Movie.Title.YEAR.480p.DVDRip.x264 and if you wish to tag your encodes with a -NAME at the end, that is fine. Save the MKV by clicking Start muxing.\r\n\r\nNow, change the Output filename by adding -SAMPLE just before the .mkv extension and open the Global tab. Check \"Enable splitting\u2026\" and choose \"\u2026after this size\" and set it to 50M. This will cut the movie into 50 megabyte chunks. Click Start musing once more and once it has finished deleted all but one 50M sample from somewhere in the middle of the movie. Remove the numbers from the end of the filename and add it to the same directory as your encode of the full movie.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/pVqXV.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[center][size=7][color=#025D8C]Congratulations, you just encoded a DVD on Mac OS X, despite the best efforts of all Mac developers.[/color][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][i]Many thanks to neebs for this guide.\r\nDiscuss or ask for help [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?page=1&action=viewthread&threadid=3826]here[/url].[/i][/size]",

    "title": "Configuring an IRC Bouncer (ZNC)",
    "body": "Ask for help [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=1675]here[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]This is a guide to installing the ZNC IRC Bouncer. The guide assumes you have a fair level of competency with Linux software and command-line tools but having said that nothing done here is very difficult.[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What is a BNC?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA Bouncer (BNC) is an IRC term for software that acts as a proxy between you and an IRC server. This concept can best be represented graphically.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://imgur.com/0m9Wb.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[i]You can read more about the BNC concept over at [url=https://bit.ly/dpr6U]Wikipedia[/url] and there is also the invaluable [url=https://znc.in/]ZNC Wiki[/url] which is an excellent reference.[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Why Would You Want a BNC?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA BNC is most commonly used with IRC networks. It is most useful for remaining connected to IRC even if your home connection goes down or your PC is turned off. You are able to receive PMs even when you are offline and can monitor/log channel activity and catch up when you are next online. Another advantage is that you are able to hide your home IP address or use vanity host names. This is not such a big deal as it used to be because most IRCd software masks IP addresses or has privacy options.\r\n\r\nIn most cases setting up a BNC will be most useful if you use a seedbox or have access to a remote server/VPS. To continue with this tutorial you will need to make sure you have access to tools for compiling software on this machine. The software which is part of the package 'build-essential' on Debian will suffice.\r\n\r\nIt is equally possible to run ZNC from a server at your home. Perhaps you have a PC on 24/7 but prefer to use IRC from a laptop, phone or tablet. You could leave IRC connected on your server and simply connect from your preferred device whenever you are around. ZNC allows a 'playback' (called a buffer) of channel activity prior to you logging back in. This can be useful if you are part of a low activity channel or simply like to know what happened overnight.\r\n\r\nThe most important application of a BNC that I have found occurs if you live in a country where the internet is less than ideally stable. A BNC can be very useful to keep you logged into IRC and avoid annoying disconnects; some servers will ban you for repeatedly disconnecting. Keep in mind your client may disconnect if your home connection is unstable but the connection to the IRC server will remain; assuming you have ZNC running on a server with a stable connection.\r\n\r\nAnother use I have found for this software is the ablility to login from anywhere - even multiple locations simultaneously. If you own an iPhone, you are able to login to IRC from home under one nick and if you wanted to login from your iPhone at the same time generally you would need to connect under a different nick - something like YourNick|iPhone. With ZNC you can connect to IRC from several locations at once and have all of your chat originate from a single nick.\r\n\r\nThis is useful if you wanted to log all activity at home but still chat at work or school or even as you are walking around town.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Why ZNC?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nZNC is the best BNC software that exists. There are several other BNC programs including irssi, psyBNC, ShroudBNC, BNC and Night Light. Feel free to check them out but I haven't used better software than ZNC.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Use the Source, Luke[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis guide is geared towards installing ZNC on a Debian server. There will be minor differences between the various linux distributions and other operating systems but the general concepts will remain the same.\r\n\r\nInstalling the stable source is easy; grab the ZNC stable [url=https://znc.in/releases/]source tarball[/url]. The stable file will have a version number, for example, znc-0.206.tar.gz. znc-latest.tar.gz is exactly what the filename suggests; the latest nightly release. Install at your own risk!\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a newer package you can install the [url=https://znc.in/releases/]nightly release[/url] or get the very latest development version from the [url=https://github.com/znc/znc]ZNC github[/url]. There is usually a few hours of difference between github and the nightly release being made available.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to install the package from your OS software repository (be careful, some repositories are quite outdated) you can skip all the way to the Initial Configuration section.\r\n\r\nOther packages you will need for compiling ZNC include: libperl-dev, libc-ares2, libc-ares-dev & pkg-config. If these are not installed on your system already you will need to be root in order to add them or have your system administrator install them.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]# aptitude install libperl-dev libc-ares2 libc-ares-dev pkg-config build-essential[/quote]\r\nIf you'd like to compile znc with SSL support (recommended) you will need to make sure you have the OpenSSL development package installed. The Debian version of this package is named libssl-dev.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]# aptitude install libssl-dev[/quote]\r\n[b]Note[/b]: install any dependancies that libssl-dev may have.\r\n\r\nNavigate to your preferred source compiling directory. I usually use /home/[b]USERNAME[/b]/src/ but you'll need to make sure you use a directory you have write permissions for.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]$ cd src/\r\n$ wget https://znc.in/releases/znc-0.206.tar.gz[/quote]\r\nThe above link is the latest stable release at time of writing, always make sure you get the latest version from [url=https://znc.in/releases/]https://znc.in/releases/[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Compilation[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAfter the tarball or git clone finishes issue the following commands to decompress, configure and install ZNC.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]$ tar -xzvf znc*.*.gz[/quote]\r\n[b]Note[/b]: The above step is only necessary if you downloaded a tarball. You can simply change into the ZNC source directory when cloning from git.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]$ cd znc*[/quote]\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]$ ./configure\r\n\r\n[indent](add --prefix=/your/chosen/install/directory if you do not want a full system install)\r\n(add --with-openssl=/path/to/openssl if you have a non-standard OpenSSL installation).[/indent][/quote]\r\n[b]Note[/b]: Unless you have root access you will probably not be able to install znc system wide so you will need to specify a location which you have write access to. I suggest something like /home/[b]USERNAME[/b]/local/znc/\r\n\r\nIf you get an error regarding memory usage then add [b]--disable-optimization[/b] to your [b]./configure[/b] command and gcc will need less memory.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]$ make[/quote]\r\n[b]Note[/b]: Compiling can take 5 - 10 minutes or more depending on your hardware. If your server has a multicore processor you can use [b]make -jX[/b] where 'X' is the number of cores your machine has. This should allow for faster building.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]$ make install[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Configuration[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAssuming compilation completed without a hitch it is now time to configure ZNC. I will use TehConnection as an example IRC network. ZNC will ask us for some information, the majority of which can be found in our [ur=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=104]IRC Article[/url].\r\n\r\nA key note is that ZNC needs a new 'user' for each IRC network you wish to join. I regularly connect to ~16 networks so this can be slightly tedious to enter all at once which is why it can be useful to be able to use the webadmin module.\r\n\r\nFor more information on any of the options available it is probably best if you use the ZNC configuration [url=https://en.znc.in/wiki/Configuration]page[/url] as a reference because it is very detailed and likley to remain updated.\r\n\r\nWe'll start ZNC with the initial makeconf argument:\r\n\r\n[quote]$ znc --makeconf[/quote]\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote][size=2][ ** ] Building new config\r\n[ ** ]\r\n[ ** ] First lets start with some global settings...\r\n[ ** ]\r\n[ ?? ] What port would you like ZNC to listen on?

Make sure you add the webadmin global module during initial setup or SSH into your server and edit the configuration file (usually ~/.znc/configs/znc.conf). Look at the global options at the top of the file. You may or may not see an entry which looks like this: LoadModule = webadmin. If it is there then we'll add some options and if it isn't then add it and add the following options.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]LoadModule = webadmin -noircport [b]SERVER_IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOSTNAME[/b] [b]PORT_YOU_WISH_TO_CONNECT_TO[/b][/quote]\r\nSave and exit the file then enter the following:\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]/etc/init.d/znc restart[/quote]\r\nThis will restart ZNC and apply the changes you have made. Now point your browser to https://[SERVER_IP_OR_HOSTNAME]:[PORT]/ and you should be greeted with a login prompt. You can login with any of the credentials already setup within ZNC (any of the users) but I suggest logging in as the admin user so you can see all the options available.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Making the Connection[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nWhen you come to connect via your favourite IRC application at home you will need to remember that you are connecting to [b]your server[/b] rather than directly to your desired IRC server.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to input the IP address or host of your server and only need to specify the username and password to connect as each particular user. I am currently testing various IRC applications because with some of them you are not able to specify a server username/password. I know xchat, Colloquy & mIRC can do this.\r\n\r\nWhen you have connected ZNC will automatically forward you all the channel data and you'll be connected! When you are comfortable after jumping up and down like I did when I first got this working:\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]/msg *status help[/quote]\r\n*status is the special znc service that you can message to directly change znc's configuration. You can do even more if you enable the [url=https://en.znc.in/wiki/Admin]admin[/url] user module.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Zooey[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nTo be able to chat in any of TehConnection's network channels you will need to authenticate with our bot, Zooey.\r\n\r\nTo set this up in ZNC you simply need to set a perform command which will be executed every time you ZNC connects to the IRC network.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]/msg *perform help[/quote]\r\n*perform is a ZNC module which handles commands to be sent after connecting to the server. Simply add your Zooey authentication command here and she will automatically invite you to your desired channels every time ZNC connects.\r\n[br /]\r\n[quote]/msg *perform add /msg Zooey AUTH SITE_NICK IRC_KEY[/quote]\r\nYour site nick must be the nick you have on site and your IRC key can be set in your [url=https://tehconnection.eu/user.php?action=edit]profile[/url]. It should not be the same as your site password.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsk for help [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=1675]here[/url].",

    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Things to Consider When Working on Unchecked Torrents[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[b]Don't check your own torrents and contact anyone who is marked as working on a torrent before doing anything significant.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]It is better to teach people how to do things right than to fix their uploads every time.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]If you are repeatedly having to fix the same uploaders descriptions tell a moderator.[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Does this torrent break any site rules?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis includes aspect ratio, frame rate and allowed CODECs/containers. Check [url=https://www.allmovie.com/]AllMovie[/url], [url=https://www.imdb.com/]IMDb[/url], [url=https://www.amazon.com]Amazon[/url], [url=https://www.dvdbeaver.com/]dvdbeaver[/url], [url=https://www.blu-ray.com/]blu-ray.com[/url], [url=https://www.avclub.com/]The A.V. Club[/url], [url=https://hidefdigest.com/]High-Def Digest[/url] or any other source for info on the DVD or Blu-ray. Also cross reference with any existing torrents. If it breaks any rules, report it.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know whether a torrent breaks the rules, put a private DoT note about your concern or confusion, and/or ask on IRC.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if you don't know if a new torrent is better quality than an existing torrent, put your thoughts in the DoT notes and/or ask on IRC.\r\n\r\nIf you are uncertain about a particular torrent it is always better to note the cause of your uncertainty and ask about it, someone else checking the same torrent later on might skip over your uncertainty entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Are all the expected files present?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAre there any archived files in the torrent (.rar/.zip etc...)? Report it.\r\n\r\nIs this a foreign language (non-English) release without English subtitles? Report if there is a similar resolution torrent with subtitles. Otherwise make it obvious that it hasn't got subtitles.\r\n\r\nIs the release altered? Use discretion, but generally report it if it has been modified from how it was originally released.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Is all the film group information correct?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAdd or check the IMDb number for the film group. Use the 'Fetch from IMDb' button. (new information cannot hurt, but this will break foreign titles already set).\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't have an IMDb number check the film doesn't already have a film group (scroll down in the film group edit page) otherwise just type a few zeros in the IMDb field to get round the error message.\r\n\r\nForeign language (that is, with a main language other than English) films should have a title of the form: Original title (aka English Title) as well as the foreign genre tag checked.\r\n\r\nCheck the genre tags against those the film has on IMDb (scroll down the film's listing to see all its genre tags there; at the top there will never be more than three, but a film can have many more than that). For genre tags that we use but imdb doesn't (i.e. Indie, Political), use discretion. For Foreign, see the previous note.\r\n\r\nFind the best trailer on [url=https://www.youtube.com/]YouTube[/url]. If there is a trailer you want to use that isn't on YouTube (on another site, for example) you could contact [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=4282&page=1]CrsrC[/url].\r\n\r\nIf there is no good trailer, perhaps use a clip from the film. If there is nothing worth using set the YouTube ID to 0000.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Is the film description as good as it could be?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nFind a poster if the uploader didn't include one.\r\n\r\nImprove the poster if they used a bad one (e.g. low-res or not in the film's original language) or used a DVD cover.\r\n\r\nGoogle and Google Search by Image (for better quality), are what I usually use for this. Try searching for the film title with and without the year and the word 'poster'. Other websites like [url=https://www.impawards.com/]IMP Awards[/url], [url=https://www.movieposterdb.com/]Movie Poster DB[/url] and [url=https://www.themoviedb.org/]TMDb[/url] can also be good for posters.\r\n\r\nYou can't directly grab the poster from IMDb, but if you view source on the view poster page the direct link is easy to find, if that looks like the best available.\r\n\r\n[b]Always[/b] use a poster rather than box art. Try to use the closest to the 'original' poster. An exception is with e.g. obscure straight-to-video releases where no theatrical poster existed, but such cases are rare; it's almost always possible to find a proper-size, proper poster.\r\n\r\nRehost the poster if the uploader's link is to a tempory address or site specific host (e.g. IMDb. TMDb, Wikipedia, PtPIMG, Awesome-IMG etc...\r\n\r\nRemove redundant info from the film description (IMDb score, genre, actors etc) but leave the structure of the description intact.\r\n\r\nUse a description from [url=https://www.allmovie.com/]AllMovie[/url] if they have one, and you are feeling generous to the film group. They are usually a lot better than IMDb.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Is the release information ship shape?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAre all the CODECs/containers set correctly? If not change them, add any quirky source info (3D etc...) to the scene information box (as described before).\r\n\r\nDoes the release have a MediaInfo log? If not, PM uploader. This includes DivX (ew).\r\n\r\nDoes the release need special edition information? Related note, remember that only DVDRs and full BDs should state 'special editions' like The Criterion Collection, Masters of Cinema and so on - so remove them if the uploader has listed such editions for an encode. Encodes should basically only ever state editions like Director's Cut, Unrated, Alternate Cut and the like.\r\n\r\nDoes the release need any Scene information? (Proper, Repack, Rerip)\r\n\r\nDVDRs should fill in the template, but scene DVDs can just have the NFO. If an uploader hasn't done this PM them asking for their best effort. If they identify which dvd it is and you can find more info, add it.\r\n\r\nWrap Screenshots.\r\n\r\nRehost any screenshots from site specific hosts like Awesome-IMG or PtPIMG. [url=https://www.imgbox.com/]IMGBox[/url] is convenient, two 250px thumbnails will fit on the same line (for screenshot comparisons).\r\n\r\nWrap NFO (If it isn't the full NFO either grab it from the torrent, check a PreDB or a site like [url=https://www.binsearch.info/]BINSearch[/url] or \r\n[url=https://www.srrdb.com/]srrdb[/url].\r\n\r\nUseful PreDBs are #Pre.Search on irc.corrupt-net.org (also available via the web at [url=https://pre.corrupt-net.org/]https://pre.corrupt-net.org/[/url] & [url=https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.rizon.net/ultrapre.talk]#ultrapre.talk on rizon.net[/url] which both have several years worth of Scene release information.\r\n\r\nIf the release name isn't filled in, work it out. Add the torrent to a client and check the folder name if you need to, but you can often find it using a PreDB (if it is scene) or [url=https://www.binsearch.info/]BINSearch[/url].\r\n\r\nMark a torrent TehConnection Original if it applies. Check [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=5651&page=3#post104131]this thread[/url]. A semi-maintained list of uploaders who have their work marked is [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=172]here[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]How does this torrent affect the film group?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nReport any trumped torrents, linking to the new torrent in the report. This includes cases of pre-retail being trumped, p2p Xvid releases being trumped and trumping based on quality.\r\n\r\nAre there any requests that could be filled? Perhaps PM the uploader if you think they can fill a request.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][color=green][size=5]Mark that torrent checked![/size=][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Other things to consider[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nSee how you are doing compared to others: [url=https://tehconnection.eu/dotstats.php]https://tehconnection.eu/dotstats.php[/url]\r\n\r\nIf at any point you are waiting on something like for a reply to a PM set the torrent to being worked on.\r\n\r\nIf you report a torrent, set it to being worked on so that it won't show up in the unmoderated list.\r\n\r\nIf a member repeatedly mucks stuff up, bring it up on IRC. Staff will be able to investigate and handle any warnings that may be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Helpful Links[/b][/size][/color]\r\nMoved to this article: https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=200",

But its not only for noobs, it contains a lot of tips most people will find pretty helpfull. It is explained so detailed even the biggest noobs can do it^^ :\r\n\r\n=== The Ultimate Guide for Anonymous and Secure Internet Usage v1.0.1 ===\r\n\r\nTable of Contents:\r\n\r\n1.

Creating TOR-Only Internet Environment \r\n17. General Daily Usage\r\n\r\nBy the time you are finished reading and implementing this guide, you will be able to securely and anonymously browse any website and to do so anonymously. No one not even your ISP or a government agent will be able to see what you are doing online. If privacy and anonymity is important to you, then you owe it to yourself to follow the instructions that are presented here. \r\n\r\nIn order to prepare this guide for you, I have used a computer that is running Windows Vista. This guide will work equally well for other versions of Windows. If you use a different operating system, you may need to have someone fluent in that operating system guide you through this process. However, most parts of the process are easily duplicated in other operating systems.\r\n\r\nI have written this guide to be as newbie friendly as possible. Every step is fully detailed and explained. I have tried to keep instructions explicit as possible. This way, so long as you patiently follow each step, you will be just fine. \r\n\r\nIn this guide from time to time you will be instructed to go to certain URLs to download files. You do NOT need TOR to get these files, and using TOR (while possible) will make these downloads very slow.\r\n\r\nThis guide may appear overwhelming. Every single step is explained thoroughly and it is just a matter of following along until you are done. Once you are finished, you will have a very secure setup and it will be well worth the effort. Even though the guide appears huge, this whole process should take at the most a few hours. You can finish it in phases over the course of several days.\r\n\r\nIt is highly recommended that you close *ALL* applications running on your computer before starting. \r\n\r\nNext:1 : Obtaining Tor Browser\r\n\r\n=== 1 : Obtaining Tor Browser ===\r\n\r\nThe first step to becoming secure and anonymous online is to setup and install something called \"TOR\". \"TOR\" is short for \"The Onion Router\". The concepts behind TOR were first implemented by the United States Military, and these principles have been used to create an extremely secure mechanism for being anonymous online. In fact, millions of people world-wide use TOR to browse the internet and communicate anonymously.\r\n\r\nTOR works by heavily encrypting your communications so that no observer can see what website you are really going to, and what information is really being sent. It all appears as a bunch of random characters to any observer. You simply use the TOR web browser just as you use any other web browser. TOR takes care of the rest. \r\n\r\nHowever, TOR by itself is not enough. Even when using TOR, a user can be compromised in a number of ways. First, some websites can be set up to attempt to reveal someone's true IP address (their true identity) by tricking their web browser or other software to transmitting that information. For this reason, anyone who uses TOR will recommend that no one have javascript or flash turned on while browsing TOR. In this guide however, I will show you a much better solution.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that of human error. Even if you have TOR installed, you may accidentally forget which browser to put in a link. You may also accidentally click on a link from another program, such as a chat program. That program might then load the link you clicked on into a non-TOR browser. When you are using TOR, you must be careful *constantly* that every link goes into the right browser, and that you do not accidentally click the wrong link. \r\n\r\nSo then, let's begin. Obtaining the TOR Browser is easy. Simply go to the following website:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.torproject.org\r\n\r\nOnce here, you may feel free to read more about what TOR is and how it works, or you may proceed to immediately download TOR.\r\n\r\nHere is how to do so:\r\n\r\n1. Click on \"Download TOR\", or \"Download\".\r\n\r\n2. You will see text that says, \"The Tor Browser Bundle contains everything you ned ... Just extract it and run. Learn more >>\r\n\r\n3. Click on this \"Learn more\" link. for the \"Tor Browser Bundle\"\r\n\r\n4. Assuming you are an English speaker, you would choose the top-most link \"English (en-US)\". Otherwise, pick the language best suited to you.\r\n\r\n5. The file being saved will be named: tor-browser-1.3.18_en-US.exe \r\n\r\nIt is ok if the number is not exactly 1.3.18, there are new versions of Tor from time to time. At the time that this guidewas written, 1.3.18 was most current. By the time you are reading this, a more current version of TOR may exist. \r\n\r\n6. Run this file.\r\n\r\n7. You will be prompted to extract this to a directory. By default, it will be set to C:UsersYouDownloads This is perfectly ok. You can also choose a different directory if you wish.\r\n\r\n8. Click \"Extract\"\r\n\r\nThat's it. TOR Browser is NOW installed. Time to test it out!\r\n\r\nNext 2 : Using and Testing Tor Browser for the first time ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 2 : Using and Testing Tor Browser for the first time ===\r\n\r\nNow you have successfully downloaded and installed the Tor Web Browser Bundle. You are no doubt anxious to begin using it. First, click on the \"start\" menu icon, the icon in the lower left of your screen with the windows logo. On the top right will be a listing that says \"You\", \"Documents\", \"Pictures\", \"Music\"... \"You\" of course will be replaced by your user name. Click on \"You\", the top most link. This will open up your main user folder.\r\n\r\nNow, locate the folder called \"Downloads\" and double click on it.\r\n\r\nNow, inside the \"Downloads\" folder, double click on the folder called \"Tor Browser\".\r\n\r\nLastly, double click on the application: \"Start Tor Browser\"\r\n\r\nWhen you do, you will see the Vidalia Control Panel appear, and you will observe as you connect to the TOR network. When this is complete, your web browser will open up and will automatically connect to the web address: check.torproject.org \r\n\r\nThis is to confirm that you are in fact using TOR. If you have followed this guide correctly, then you will see the following green text, or something similar:\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor.\"\r\n\r\nNow you can use this web browser the same as any other. You can go to any website you wish, and neither your ISP or anyone else will be able to see where you are going, or what you are doing. However, there are still issues that need to be resolved, so don't begin browsing just yet.\r\n\r\n*************************************\r\n***** IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE *****\r\n*************************************\r\nIf you fill out a form containing your email address, your name, or any other sensitive information while using the TOR browser, be aware that sometimes it is possible for an observer to see that information. When using TOR, use it to access websites and content that you are *not* connected to via your real identity or any username or nick name which links to your real identity. Let TOR be for anonymous browsing solely. Do your online banking, or any other activities involving your real identity using your normal web browser.\r\n************************************\r\n\r\nNext: 3 : Securing Your Hard Drive ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 3 : Securing Your Hard Drive ===\r\n\r\nBeing able to browse anonymously is one thing. However, you may choose to download and save sensitive content or material to your computer which you wish to keep private. This may include reading sensitive documents, viewing pictures, or storing any kind of sensitive data. \r\n\r\nIf you save *anything* to your computer's harddrive, then it is possible for someone who has confiscated your computer to determine what it was you saved. This is often true even if you delete the content. For example, suppose I use the Tor Browser and I navigate to a website containing a sensitive document that I wish to read. If I saved that document somewhere on my harddrive, then it is possible for someone else to find it. If I *delete* that document, it may still be possible for someone to undelete it. \r\n\r\nFurther, even if I never save it to my harddrive but I simply look at it using my word processing software, it may still be saved in a number of ways including:\r\n\r\n1. Often programs keep records of filenames. The filename alone is often enough to incriminate someone.\r\n\r\n2. Often programs keep parts of the content viewed saved for various reasons, such as for searching. This can include random excerpts of text, thumbnails of images, and more. Often this \"partial\" data is more than enough to prove what the original data was. Often  the \"partial\" data is itself incriminating.\r\n\r\n3. Sometimes, especially if you are running low on system memory, your operating system may choose to use your hard-disk as a temporary RAM. This is known as \"SWAP\". Normally, whenever you turn off your computer, whatever was in RAM is deleted. However, the data that goes to your SWAP may persist and it may be possible for someone to see what content you had open in your programs if that information is saved in RAM.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, you *must* have a plan to secure any content that is saved to your hard disk. Therefore, this guide would be incomplete if we did not thoroughly address this. First, there are two kinds of such content:\r\n\r\n1. Deliberately saved content.\r\n2. Inadvertently saved content.\r\n\r\nDeliberately saved content refers to content that you have chosen to save on your harddisk so that you can access this content later. We will\r\naddress how to do this later in the guide.\r\n\r\nInadvertently saved content refers to content that is saved by programs you use, or your operating system. You have no way to even know what this content might be. Therefore, this is the most dangerous. You may browse and find a dozen sensitive documents, utterly delete them, and some program may have saved the file names and excerpts of the data. This will render your previous efforts futile. \r\n\r\nContent that is inadvertently saved to your harddisk comes in two flavors:\r\n\r\n1. Content that is saved to your SWAP space.\r\n\r\n2. Content that is saved by applications running on your computer, including your operating system.\r\n\r\nThe surest way to prevent content from writing to your SWAP space is to disable your SWAP space altogether. This may result in your computer\r\nrunning a bit slower than normal, and may mean that you cannot use ram intensive games and applications during the time your SWAP is disabled.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you use this method, simply turn back on the SWAP when you want to use those ram intensive applications. Also, you may choose not\r\nto take this step. \r\n \r\n \r\n1 - Here is how to disable your swap space if you are using Windows 7:\r\n\r\n*** ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS BELOW. SKIP THIS IF YOU ARE NOVICE OR UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS OPERATION ***\r\n\r\n*This step is recommended for advanced users only. If you are not comfortable doing this, you may safely skip this step.*\r\n\r\nInstructions are less verbose than usual, as these steps are intended for advanced users only. If you do not fully understand these instructions, skip this step.\r\n\r\n1. From Control Panel, go to \"System and Security\".\r\n\r\n2. Click on \"System\", and then choose \"Advanced system settings\" in the left-most menu.\r\n\r\n3. Under the \"Advanced\" tab, under \"Performance\", click \"Settings\".\r\n\r\n4. Under this \"Advanced\" tab, under \"Virtual Memory\", click \"Change\".\r\n\r\n5. Uncheck \"Automatically manage paging file sizes for all drives\".\r\n\r\n6. Select \"No paging file\".\r\n\r\n7. Save, reboot, and follow these same first 5 steps to confirm that \"No paging file\" is still selected. This means that you have successfully disabled your swap. This means that *nothing* from RAM will be inadvertently saved to your harddrive. \r\n\r\nTo resume using SWAP again, simply click \"Automatically manage paging file size for all drives.\" You can switch between these two modes as you desire.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, your computer will run fine without a swap file, provided you have enough RAM. \r\n\r\n*** END OF ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS ***\r\n\r\nThe next issue we need to address is how to prevent applications and/or your operating system from saving content inadvertently that you do not want \r\nsaved. For this, we are going to set up a \"Virtual Machine\".\r\n\r\nA \"Virtual Machine\" is like a computer inside of your computer. Everything you do inside the Virtual Machine (vm for short) will be fully contained within\r\nitself and no one will be able to see what the vm has been doing. Ideally, you want *ALL* of your sensitive computer usage of any kind, TOR or NON TOR, to take place within a vm. In this way, you can keep everything private that you wish while still using your computer fully and getting the most out of it.\r\n\r\nDon't be afraid of this sounds complicated. This guide will take you through every step slowly and methodically. Before we can set up a vm however, we need to take another step.\r\n\r\nNext: 4 : Setting up TrueCrypt, Encrypted Hidden Volumes ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 4 : Setting up TrueCrypt, Encrypted Hidden Volumes ===\r\n\r\nIf you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. You want a way to protect that\r\ninformation so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. Therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.\r\n\r\nThe best such system for this is called \"True Crypt\". \"True Crypt\" is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. Further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password.\r\n\r\nThis sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up. We are going to do so, right now:\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to https://www.truecrypt.org, and click on \"Downloads\")\r\n2. Under \"Latest Stable Version\", under \"Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000\", click \"Download\"\r\n3. The file will be called \"True Crypt Setup 7.0a.exe\" or something similar. Run this file.\r\n4. If prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click \"Continue\".\r\n5. Check \"I accept and agree to be bound by these license terms\"\r\n6. Click \"Accept\"\r\n7. Ensure that \"Install\" is selected, and click \"Next\"\r\n8. click \"Install\"\r\n9. You will see a dialog stating \"TrueCrypt has been successfully installed.\" Click \"Ok\"\r\n10. Click \"No\" when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user's guide.\r\n11. Click \"Finish\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, TrueCrypt is now installed. Now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.\r\n\r\n1. Click the \"Windows Logo\"/\"Start\" button on the lower left corner of your screen. \r\n2. Click \"All Programs\"\r\n3. Click \"TrueCrypt\"\r\n4. Click the \"TrueCrypt\" application\r\n\r\nAnd now we can begin:\r\n\r\n1. click the button \"Create Volume\"\r\n2. Ensuring that \"Create an encrypted file container\" is selected, click \"Next\"\r\n3. Select \"Hidden TrueCrypt volume\" and click \"Next\".\r\n4. Ensuring that \"Normal mode\" is selected, click \"Next\"\r\n5. Click on \"Select File\"\r\n\r\nNote which directory you are in on your computer. Look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. An input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. Here, you will type in the following filename:\r\n\r\nrandom.txt\r\n\r\nYou may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. This file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside.\r\nDo NOT use a filename for a file that already exists. The idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended though not required that you \"hide\" this file somewhere less obvious. If it is in your home directory, then someone who has\r\naccess to your computer may find it easier. You can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesn't have to be your hard disk. You could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. It is up to you. \r\n\r\n6. Once you have typed in the file name, click \"Save\"\r\n7. Make sure \"Never save history\" is checked.\r\n8. Click \"Next\"\r\n9. On the \"Outer Volume\" screen, click \"Next\" again.\r\n10. The default Encryption Algorithm and Hash Algorithm are fine. Click \"Next\"\r\n11. Choose a file size. \r\n\r\nIn order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. If not, then it is worth it for you to purchase\r\nsome form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. TrueCrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk. If you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with \r\n(such as 100 MB). \r\n\r\nIdeally, you want to choose enough space to work with. I recommend 20 GB at least. Remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create additional TrueCrypt volumes using exactly these same steps. \r\n \r\n12. Now you are prompted for a password. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. READ THIS CAREFULLY\r\n\r\n*** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY ***\r\n\r\n*** The password you choose here is a decoy password. That means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. Suppose that someone suspects *** that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. THIS is the password that you  *** give to them. When you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the RIGHT password. Further, they cannot *** even know that there is a second password. \r\n\r\nHere are some tips for your password:\r\n\r\nA. Choose a password you will NEVER forget. It may be ten years from now that you need it. Make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times. \r\nB. Make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. If the password is something stupid like \"123\" then they may not believe you.\r\nC. Remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. It is *NOT* your actual password. \r\nD. Do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. You do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.\r\n\r\nAnd with all of this in mind, choose your password. When you have typed it in twice, click \"Next\". \r\n\r\n13. \"Large Files\", here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4 GIGABYTES. Choose \"No\" and click \"Next\"\r\n14. \"Outer Volume Format\", here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says \"Random Pool\". Go ahead and move your mouse around for a bit. This will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. After about ten seconds of this, click \"Format\".\r\n15. Depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting. \r\n\r\n\"What is happening?\"\r\n\r\nTrueCrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as \"random.txt\". It is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. This file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. Further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. To *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. No one will even know that\r\nit is a truecrypt volume. \r\n\r\n16. \"Outer Volume Contents\", click on the button called, \"Open Outer Volume\"\r\n\r\nAn empty folder has opened up. This is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.\r\n\r\n*** *** DO NOT PUT ANY SENSITIVE CONTENT HERE *** *** \r\n\r\nThis is the \"Decoy\". This is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. This is NOT where you are going to store your sensitive data. If you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. You need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. Here are some important tips to keep in mind:\r\n\r\nA. Do NOT use porn. Adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally. \r\nB. Do NOT use drawings/renderings /writings of porn. In many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs. \r\nC. Good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc. \r\nD. Once you have placed files into this folder, *NEVER* place any more files in the future. Doing so may damage your hidden content.\r\n\r\nGenerally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used TrueCrypt to secure that data. \r\n\r\nNow, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. Be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. The more the better. \r\n\r\nWhen you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the \"x\" in the top right corner.\r\n\r\n17. click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n18. If prompted that \"A program needs your permission to continue\", click \"Continue\"\r\n19. \"Hidden Volume\", click \"Next\"\r\n20. The default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click \"Next\"\r\n21. \"Hidden Volume Size\", the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box. Round down to the nearest full unit. For example, if 19.97 GB is available, select 19 GB. If 12.0 GB are available, select 11 GB. \r\n22. If a warning dialog comes up, asking \"Are you sure you wish to continue\", select \"Yes\"\r\n23. \"Hidden Volume Password\"\r\n\r\n*** IMPORTANT READ THIS ***\r\n\r\nHere you are going to select the REAL password. This is the password you will NEVER reveal to ANYONE else under any circumstances. Only you will know it. No one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. Be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out. They cannot. \r\n\r\nIt is HIGHLY recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. If it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. A date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.\r\n\r\n24. Type in your password twice, and click \"Next\"\r\n25. \"Large Files\", select \"Yes\" and click \"Next\".\r\n26. \"Hidden Volume Format\", as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click \"Format\".\r\n27. If prompted \"A program needs your permission to continue\", select \"Continue\"\r\n28. A dialog will come up telling you that the hidden TrueCrypt volume has been successfully created. Click \"Ok\"\r\n29. Click \"Exit\"\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. Anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. Further, you have protected this content with TWO passwords. One that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. Keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.\r\n\r\nNow, we should test BOTH passwords.\r\n\r\nNext:5. Testing TrueCrypt Volumes ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 5. Testing TrueCrypt Volumes ===\r\n\r\nOnce you have completed the above section, you will be back at TrueCrypt. Go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.\r\n\r\n1. Click \"Select File...\"\r\n2. Locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called \"random.txt\" or something similar. Remember that even though there is both an outer and\r\na hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a single file. There are not two files, only one.\r\n3. Click \"Open\"\r\n4. Choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past M is probably just fine). Click on that, For example click on \"O:\" to highlight it.\r\n5. Click \"Mount\"\r\n6. Now you are prompted for a password. Read the below carefully:\r\n\r\nThe password you provide here will determine WHICH volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified. If you type in your decoy password, then O: will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced. If you type in your real password, then O: will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see.\r\n\r\n7. After successfully typing in your password, you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter, including the full path to the file you selected\r\nas well as the kind of volume it is (for example, hidden).\r\n8. Right click on your \"Windows Logo\"/\"Start Menu\" icon, and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. You will see the drive letter you selected, for example: \"Local Disk (O:)\". Click on that.\r\n9. If you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. If you selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any. \r\n\r\nIf you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. Be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. We will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide. \r\n\r\n\"What is happening?\"\r\n\r\nWhen you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. It is the same thing as if\r\nyou had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. TrueCrypt causes your computer to think that there is an \r\nentirely new disk drive on your computer. You can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. You can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive. \r\n\r\nWhen you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click \"Dismount\" from within TrueCrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. This will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.\r\n\r\n*** VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ***\r\n\r\nWhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. If for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume. Therefore:\r\n\r\n*** ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DISMOUNT ANY TRUECRYPT VOLUME CONTAINING ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION WHEN YOU ARE NOT USING YOUR COMPUTER ***\r\n\r\nYou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of \"TrueCrypt\"'s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter. \r\n\r\nYou should practice Mounting and Dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process. \r\n\r\nOnce you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do *NOT* touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. Remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. Once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. From that point forward, use ONLY the hidden volume. The outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it.\r\n\r\nNext:6. Securing your Disk ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 6. Securing your Disk ===\r\n\r\nThis is an involved step which many people may not be able to do right away. If you cannot do this step immediately, then see section 7. \r\n\r\nAt this point you should understand how to create and use TrueCrypt hidden volumes in order to safeguard any sensitive information. Therefore, you should *NOT* keep any such sensitive information on your hard disk. \r\n\r\nAt this stage, there are two possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. You have never had any sensitive information on your hard disk. In this case, read this section but you can certainly skip it.\r\n2. Up until now, you have stored sensitive information on your hard disk. If so, then you MUST read this section. \r\n\r\nIf you have ever used this computer to access sensitive information, then all of the security and precautions in the world are totally useless and futile because all someone has to do is access what is left of that sensitive information. I cannot stress this enough.\r\n\r\nYou can have the most secure TrueCrypt volumes, use TOR, and be the safest most secure user in the world. If you have not made sure that *ALL* remnants of any sensitive information are UTTERLY REMOVED from your hard disk, then all of that effort is totally pointless. You MUST take these actions to safeguard your hard disk, or otherwise you might as well throw away this guide and follow none of the advice herein.\r\n\r\nFirst, I understand that it is troublesome to have to re-format a computer, to back everything up, and reinstall everything. However, if you have ever had sensitive information on your machine, that is what you have to do. Take the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Obtain a removable harddrive or usb flash drive large enough to store anything you need to save.\r\n2. Set up a truecrypt hidden volume on that harddrive big enough to hold all of that information.\r\n3. Set up the truecrypt outer volume as in the previous section. Use the previous section as a guide if you need to. \r\n4. Be sure you the hidden volume will have enough space to store all that you are backing up.\r\n5. Copy ALL data you need to back up/save into that hidden volume. \r\n\r\n*** IMPORTANT, READ THIS ***\r\n\r\nIf you have ever used this system to access sensitive information, then you must assume that the sensitive information or remnants of it can be *anywhere* on your hard disk. Therefore, you need to move *EVERYTHING* you intend to save into the hidden truecrypt container. You do not know where sensitive data might be, so you are assuming it can be anywhere. This way you still have ALL of your data and you have lost nothing. \r\n\r\nA good analogy is toxic waste. You don't know which barrel might contain the toxic waste, so you treat *ALL* the barrels as potentially toxic. This is the \r\nsurest way you can protect yourself. \r\n\r\nYou might be saying, \"I have family photos, music, movies that I would have to move to the hidden volume.\" That is perfectly fine. Remember that you can access that hidden volume just as if it was a drive letter. In fact, ideally, *ALL* of the content on your computer (assuming you value your privacy) should be  protected anyways. You lose nothing by securing all of that data. \r\n\r\n6. Once you have copied everything you intend to copy. dismount your hidden volume, reboot your computer, and re-mount your hidden volume to make sure everything is there.\r\n7. Now it is time to re-format your entire hard drive. Re-install your operating system of choice (such as Windows 7), and start with a clean slate. \r\n8. Once you have reinstalled your operating system from scratch, follow sections one through five of this guide to reach this point, and then proceed.\r\n \r\nNext:7. Temporarily Securing Your Disk, Shredding Free Space ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 7. Temporarily Securing Your Disk, Shredding Free Space ===\r\n\r\nLike the previous section, this section applies ONLY IF there is some risk that sensitive data has ever been stored or accessed on this computer. If you are 100% sure that sensitive information has never been accessed using this computer, then you can safely skip this and the previous step. \r\n\r\nIf you are not prepared to take the actions in the previous step yet, then you should follow the steps in this section until you can. However, you MUST eventually take the actions in step six above. Do not assume you can find/delete all sensitive content. Lists of filenames, image thumbnails, random\r\ndata, and more *ARE* sitting on your hard disk. Someone who knows how to find it, WILL. That will render all of your other precautions totally futile. \r\n\r\nAs soon as you can, follow the instructions in step six. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, here is how you can temporarily safeguard yourself until you are able to follow those instructions.\r\n\r\n1. Go through your hard disk folder by folder, deleting (or moving to a truecrypt hidden volume) any files that you believe are sensitive/risky.\r\n\r\n2. When you are totally sure that you have deleted all such files, go to the following URL: https://www.fileshredder.org\r\n\r\n3. Scroll down and look for the button called \"Download File Shredder\" -- do NOT click any other button, as the page may have ads on it that appear to be download links.\r\n\r\n4. Save the file.\r\n\r\n5. Run the file, most likely titled: file_shredder_setup.exe\r\n\r\n6. \"Welcome to the File Shredder Setup Wizard\", Click \"Next\" \r\n\r\n7. Select \"I accept the agreement\" and click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n8. It will choose where to install it, click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n9. Click \"Next\" again when prompted for the Start Menu folder.\r\n\r\n10. \"Select Additional Tasks\", Click \"Next\" again \r\n\r\n11. Click \"Install\"\r\n\r\n12. Ensuring that \"Launch File Shredder\" is checked, click \"Finish\"\r\n\r\n13. You should now notice that \"File Shredder\" is running. You should see the program in your task bar. Click on it to bring up the control panel if it is not up already.\r\n\r\n14. On the left is a link that says \"Shred Free Disk Space\", click it.\r\n\r\n15. Choose the drive letter for your hard disk, typically C:, as well as any other drives you wish to shred the free space.\r\n\r\n16. under \"Select Secure Algorithm\", select \"Secure Erasing Algorithm with 7 passes\" and click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n17. Click \"Start\"\r\n\r\nThis will take some time to finish. Once you have finished shredding your free disk space, it will be impossible or nearly impossible for someone to find one of your deleted files and piece it back together to see what it once was. However, this is NOT enough.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that there may still be records of the filenames that were deleted, partial data from those files, image thumbnails, and more that may be enough to incriminate you. This is only a temporary step you have taken, and you absolutely must take the actions in step 6 above in order to be truly safe.\r\n\r\nNext:8. Installing VirtualBox\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 8. Installing VirtualBox\r\n\r\nAnd now we get to the fun part. We are going to create a secure environment for you to browse the internet and communicate in a way that is totally anonymous and untraceable. You will have a setup that is so secure as to be virtually impossible to break. \r\n\r\n1. First, go to the following URL: https://www.virtualbox.org\r\n\r\n2. Select \"Downloads\" in the menu on the left.\r\n\r\n3. Under \"VirtualBox platform packages\" is \"VirtualBox 4.0.4 for Windows Hosts\", next to that is \"x86/amd64\". Click that.\r\n\r\n4. Save the file. It should be titled similar to: \"VirtualBox-4.0.4-7011-Win.exe\r\n\r\n5. Run the file.\r\n\r\n6. \"Welcome to the Oracle VM... Setup Wizard\", Click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n7. click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n8. Click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n9. \"Warning: Network Interfaces\", click \"Yes\" but be aware that your internet connection will be temporarily reset for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n10. Click \"Install\"\r\n\r\n11. A dialog saying \"A program needs your permission to continue\" may appear, click \"Continue\".\r\n\r\n12. One or more dialogs asking if you want to install \"device software\" may come up, select \"Install\" each time. \r\n\r\n13. Optionally check the box \"Always trust software from Oracle Corporation.\"\r\n\r\n14. \"Oracle VM... installation is complete\", Click \"Finish\" ensuring that \"Start Oracle VM after installation\" is checked.\r\n\r\nNow we have the software we need in order to set up and run virtual machines. On your task bar to the far right, you should notice VirtualBox running. Click on the \"VirtualBox\" icon if needed in order to bring the VirtualBox control panel into view.\r\n\r\nNow it is time to set up a virtual machine. For this, we need to obtain two files. Operating systems, such as windows, are typically installed using a cd or dvd. You put the cd or dvd into your computer, you boot it up, and you follow the instructions in order to install the operating system. Virtual machines\r\nwork similarly. Before we can use a virtual machine, we have to install an operating system on it.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are *NOT* going to use Windows! We are going to use Linux. Do not be afraid if you have no experience using Linux. I assure you that this will prove to be painless. We actually need two different linux operating systems in order to have a secure system. Before we go through the steps of setting this up, I want to describe to you what we are doing.\r\n\r\nRemember earlier in the guide I explained that one of the downsides to using Tor Browser from your main computer is that you might accidentally put a link into a non-Tor browser. The problem with your computer right now is that you can access tor sites, or non-tor sites equally well. That means that you have to be extremely careful to ensure that you are using Tor. \r\n\r\nAn analogy would be to say that you are typing on a keyboard with red and green keys. You have to be careful to only hit the green keys. If you accidentally hit a red key, then you could compromise your security and anonymity. That is *not* a good position to be in. The purpose of setting up a virtual machine is to make certain that you cannot accidentally reveal your identity or compromise your security. \r\n\r\nThe computer you are using now has two ways of accessing the internet: TOR, and Non-TOR. The virtualmachine we are setting up however will only be able to access the internet using TOR. No other way period. That means that no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, you will NOT be able to accidentally access any website except through TOR. This *guarantees* that whatever you do on that virtual machine is going to be through TOR. \r\n\r\nSo how do we achieve this? There are a number of ways to do so. The method presented in this guide is not the only good way, however I do believe that it is both easy to set up and also friendly to users who may not have a great deal of RAM. \r\n\r\nFirst, we are going to set up two different virtual machines. One of them will exist for the sole purpose of making sure that the other one does not accidentally connect to the internet except through TOR. This virtual machine requires very little. You will not be using it for anything. It will simply act as a gatekeeper to ensure that the other Virtual Machine is safe.\r\n\r\nThe second virtual machine will be what you use for internet browsing, chatting, etc. This virtual machine will be configured in such a way that it can only use TOR and nothing else. The way we will achieve this is to force this second virtual machine to go through the first virtual machine for all internet connections.\r\n\r\nDo not worry if this seems complicated. As with the rest of this guide, I am going to walk you through step by step exactly what to do.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have to obtain the operating systems we will need. In this case, we are going to use \"Damn Small Linux\" (yes that is it's real name) for the firewall and we are going to use \"Ubuntu\" for the main system. The advantage to using \"Damn Small Linux\" is that we only need 32 MB of ram and no disk sapce to have an effective firewall. \r\n\r\nLet's set up the firewall first:\r\n\r\nNext:9. Installing a Firewall ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 9. Installing a Firewall ===\r\n\r\n1. First, go to the following URL: https://www.damnsmalllinux.org (three l's)\r\n2. Scroll down until you see a link that says \"Download\"\r\n3. Under \"Current Full Mirror List\", click any that work. Some may not work at any given time. If one doesn't work, simply hit back on your browser and try another one.\r\n4. At the time of this guide, the following url worked: ftp://ftp.is.co.za/linux/distributions/damnsmall/current/\r\n5. Go to the \"current\" directory if not already in it. \r\n6. Click on the file called: dsl-4.4.10.iso -- If you cannot find this file, choose the file closet to it. A higher version number is fine. The file will probably be about 50 MB\r\n7. The file should take about 5-10 minutes to download based on your connection. \r\n\r\n(IF THE ABOVE STEPS WORKED FOR YOU, SKIP THIS MINI-SECTION)\r\n\r\n(If you had trouble with the above steps, read this mini-section)\r\n(With mirrors, it is often the case that a particular mirror site doesn't work. At the time of this writing, several mirrors worked. I am providing detailed instructions for each mirror.)\r\n(Above I have already provided instructions for the mirror)\r\nftp://ftp.is.co.za\r\n\r\nMIRROR: https://gd.tuwien.ac.at/opsys/linux/damnsmall \r\n(Go to this URL, and under \"Subdirectories\" click on \"current\") if available, select the file called \"current.iso\" (provided the file is at least 49 MB in size) If not, then choose the closest file to dsl-4.4.10.iso, a higher version # is fine.\r\n\r\nMIRROR: https://ftp.belnet.be/packages/damnsmalllinux/ \r\n(go to \"current\" directory, obtain either \"current.iso\" (if 49 MB or higher) or find file closest to \"dsl-4.4.10.iso\")\r\n\r\nMIRROR: https://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/damnsmalllinux.org/\r\n(go to \"current\" directory, obtain either \"current.iso\" (if 49 MB or higher) or find file closest to \"dsl-4.4.10.iso\")\r\n\r\nAt this point, you should have the file either \"current.iso\" or \"dsl-4.4.10.iso\" (or something similar) fully downloaded and saved into your Downloads directory.\r\n\r\nNow, go ahead and open up VirtualBox again, most likely by clicking it on the task bar. \r\n\r\n8. Click \"New\" at the top left, an icon that resembles a many-pointed round star.\r\n9. \"Welcome to the New Virtual Machine Wizard\", click \"Next\"\r\n10. \"VM Name and OS Type\": Under \"Name\" type in: Firewall\r\n11. For Operating System, choose \"Linux\"\r\n12. For \"Version\", choose: \"Other Linux\"\r\n13. Click \"Next\"\r\n14. \"Memory\", select \"32 MB\" and click Next\r\n15. \"Virtual Hard Disk\", Uncheck \"Boot Hard Disk\" and click \"Next\"\r\n16. If a Warning dialog appears, click \"Continue\"\r\n17. Click \"Finish\"\r\n18. Now you will notice \"Firewall, Powered Off\" visible in your VirtualBox control panel. Make sure it is highlighted (it should be) and then right click it, and select \"Settings\".\r\n19. Select \"Network\" in the menu to the left.\r\n20. Click on the \"Adapter 2\" tab.\r\n21. Check \"Enable Network Adapter\" and next to where it says \"Attached to\", select \"Internal Network\" from the pulldown menu.\r\n22. Click \"Ok\" at the bottom.\r\n23. Once again, right click \"Firewall, Powered Off\" and select \"Start\"\r\n24. Check \"Do not show this message again\" and click \"Ok\". This is just letting you know that the \"RIGHT CTRL KEY\" on your keyboard is the \"control\" key for this virtual machine.\r\n25. \"Welcome to the First Run Wizard\", click \"Next\"\r\n26. \"Select Installation Media\", under \"Media Source\" is a pull down menu. To the immediate right of that pull down menu is an icon with a folder. Click that folder icon.\r\n27. Locate \"current.iso\" or \"dsl-4.4.10.iso\" (or the similar file name) that you downloaded. When located, click \"Open\". It is likely in the \"Downloads\" directory of your home folder.\r\n28. Click \"Next\"\r\n29. Click \"Finish\"\r\n\r\nNow the virtual machine will start to boot up. Simply wait... (This may take up to 5 minutes.)\r\n\r\n30. One or more new dialogs may come up saying \"VirtualBox Information\", just click \"Do not show this message again\" and click \"Ok\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, the booting will finish and you will be looking at the desktop for your firewall virtual machine. To the right of the window you will see some stats that look something like this:\r\n\r\nUp: 0 k/s - Down: 0 k/s\r\nProcesses: 19\r\nCPU Usage: 10%\r\nRAM Usage: 16.2MB/28.8MB\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You now have a firewall running. Now we will set up this firewall to protect you so that you can safely use TOR from your main virtual machine.\r\n \r\nNext:10. Firewall Configuration ===\r\n=== 10. Firewall Configuration ===\r\n\r\nAt this stage you should be looking at the desktop for \"DSL\" (Damn Small Linux). \r\n\r\nI need to talk about the mouse first. This particular virtual machine as well as your main operating system (windows) both want control of your mouse. Both cannot have control of your mouse at the same time however. Therefore, you have to choose whether the mouse will be used by your virtual machine, or by Windows. When you click into your virtual machine, it has the effect of passing control of the mouse to the virtual machine. That means you cannot move your mouse cursor past the boundaries of that virtual machine. In order to give mouse control back to windows, enabling you to move your mouse cursor anywhere, simply press the right ctrl key on your keyboard. That is to say, you have two ctrl keys. One on the left of your keyboard, and one on the right. Press the ctrl key that is on the right of your keyboard. This will give mouse control back to windows.\r\n\r\nPractice this a bit. Practice clicking into the window, moving the mouse cursor around, pressing right ctrl, and moving the windows mouse cursor around. Get the feel of it.\r\n\r\nYou should see a window that looks something like a web browser, with some text in it including words such as \"Getting Started with DSL\". First, close that window.\r\n\r\n(If your mouse is not working, read this mini-section.)\r\n\r\n(First, click inside the window that your virtual machine is running in). Now try moving your mouse cursor. If you do not see the mouse cursor moving around, then press (RIGHT CTRL + I). Now move your mouse cursor again. If you notice that you are moving your \"main\" mouse cursor over the window, but you do not see the \"DSL\" black mouse cursor moving, then click again into that window. If you do this a few times, you should notice that the mouse begins to work. You may have to press RIGHT CTRL+I a couple of times to get the mouse to work.\r\n\r\n1. Once the mouse is working inside of your virtual machine, go ahead and close the window entitled \"Getting Started with DSL\"\r\n\r\n(If you cannot see the full virtual machine window, for example because your screen resolution is set so that some of the window goes too low, read this mini-section).\r\n\r\n(First, press RIGHT CTRL+I until you have your main windows white mouse cursor back). Now, click on \"Machine\" in the menu at the top of the window.\r\n(Select \"Switch to Scale Mode\")\r\n\r\n( Click \"Switch\")\r\n\r\n(Now you will have converted your firewall window to a smaller size, and you will be able to resize it. You may need to press \"right ctrl\" to get a windows mouse cursor (which you will need in order to resize this window). Now simply resize it to the size that works for you, and then click into the window to be able to use the black mouse cursor inside the virtual machine. I recommend you maximize this window to make sure you can read everything clearly.\r\n\r\n2. Right click anywhere on the desktop, go to System (a red folder), go to Daemons, ssh, and start. \r\n\r\n3. Right click again anywhere on the desktop, go to XShells -> Root Access -> Transparent\r\n\r\n4. Now you have a window that you can type in. Type exactly as shown below into this window, and hit enter:\r\n\r\npasswd\r\n\r\nOnce you type this and hit enter, it will ask you for a password. This is a password for full access to the firewall. Make it at least 8 characters in size.\r\n\r\n*** IMPORTANT: Do not forget your firewall password. You will need it later in the guide. ***\r\n\r\nWhen you have successfully changed your password, it will say \"Password changed.\"\r\n\r\n5. Now type exactly as shown below, into the same window:\r\n\r\nifconfig eth1 10.0.3.1\r\n\r\n6. It will not say anything after you hit enter, it will just return you back to the prompt. \r\n\r\nNow our firewall server is ready. We want to save this state so that we can get back to it easy in the future.\r\nPress RIGHT CTRL+S\r\n\r\n7. Now you will be looking at a window that says \"Take Snapshot of Virtual Machine\". Just click \"Ok\"\r\n\r\n8. Now, let's test this out to confirm it works as we expect. Go ahead and close the virtual machine by clicking the \"X\" in the top right corner. A menu will come up. Select \"Power off the machine\" and click ok. Do NOT check the box called \"Restore current snapshot\".\r\n\r\nAnd now you should be once again at the VirtualBox manager. You will see \"Firewall (Shapshot 1), Powered Off\"\r\n\r\n9. Make sure that \"Firewall (Snapshot 1), Powered Off\" is selected. At the top right of your VirtualBox Manager is a button that says: \"Snapshots (1)\". Click it.\r\n\r\n10. Click on \"Snapshot 1\", the top-most selection. This will highlight it.\r\n\r\n11. Now right click it, and click on \"Restore Snapshot\"\r\n\r\n12. A dialog box will come up asking if you are sure, click \"Restore\"\r\n\r\n13. Now click the \"Start\" button at the top with the large green arrow.\r\n\r\n14. Any dialog boxes that come up with a check box saying \"Do not show this information again\", simply check the check-box, and click ok. Do not worry about any of those.\r\n\r\nRemember, if you do not have immediate control of the mouse inside the virtual machine, simply press RCTRL+I (press right ctrl and \"I\" at the same time) and click into it until you have mouse control. \r\n\r\nNow your firewall is good to go. Any time you need it, just go to the VirtualBox Manager and follow steps 9 through 14 above. You do not have to go through the whole setup process again at any time in the future. Your firewall is ready.\r\n\r\nNext:11. Installing Ubuntu ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 11. Installing Ubuntu ===\r\n\r\nNow we are going to set up the main machine that you will be using TOR with. \r\n\r\n1. First, go to this URL: https://www.ubuntu.com\r\n\r\n2. Click on the link \"Download Ubuntu\"\r\n\r\n3. Click \"Start Download\" (This download should take 10-15 minutes)\r\n\r\n4. The filename is going to be similar to: ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso\r\n\r\nNow we wait... \r\n\r\nWhile you are waiting for the file to download, go ahead and make sure that your \"hidden volume\" is mounted in TrueCrypt to a particular drive letter. For example, O: You will need that for the next step.\r\n\r\n5. Return to your \"VirtualBox Manager\". It doesn't matter if the firewall is running or not.\r\n\r\n6. Click \"New\" (the blue round star-icon in the top left) again.\r\n\r\n7. \"Welcome to the New VirtualMachine Wizard\", click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n8. \"VM Name and OS Type\", under \"Name\", type \"Primary\"\r\n\r\n9. Next to \"Operating System\", select \"Linux\"\r\n\r\n10. Next to \"Version\", select \"Ubuntu\" and Click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n11. \"Memory\", by default it selects 512 MB. This is fine. 256 MB is the MINIMUM. The more memory you allocate, the better the virtual machine will function. Click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n12. \"Virtual Hard Disk\", Make sure \"Boot Hard Disk\" is checked. Make sure \"Create new hard disk\" is selected. Click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n13. \"Welcome to the Create New Virtual Disk Wizard\", click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n14. \"Hard Disk Storage Type\", select \"Fixed-size storage\" and click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n15. \"Virtual Disk Location and Size\", to the right of the text box containing \"Primary\" is a folder icon. Click the folder icon.\r\n\r\n16. Now we have to select a file for the new hard disk image file. On the bottom of this dialog it says \"Browse Folders\", click on that. \r\n\r\n17. Now click on \"Computer\" in the menu to the left. \r\n\r\n18. Scroll to where you see the drive letter you mounted, and double click on it. Ex: Local Disk (O:) \r\n\r\n19. Now click \"Save\"\r\n\r\n20. By default 8.00 GB are selected. That is fine. If you have enough space on your hidden volume, increase this to 10 GB. Otherwise, 8 is fine.\r\n\r\n21. Under \"Location\", it should say O:Primary.vdi where O: is replaced by whatever drive letter you mounted your TrueCrypt hidden volume to.\r\n\r\n22. Click \"Next\", then click \"Finish\"\r\n\r\nNow we wait for VirtualBox to create the hard drive we asked for. This may take a few minutes.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind this entire virtual machine as well as any of its contents are going to reside within the hidden truecrypt container. This ensures extra security.\r\n\r\n23. When this is done, you will see a \"Summary\" window. Click \"Finish\".\r\n\r\n24. Now, right click on \"Primary, Powered Off\" in your \"VirtualBox Manager\", and click \"Start\"\r\n\r\n25. Again we are at the \"First Run Wizard\", click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n26. \"Select Installation Media\", under \"Media Source\" is a pull down menu. Click the \"folder icon\" to the immediate right of that pulldown menu.\r\n\r\n27. Locate \"ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386\" (or the similarly named file) from your Downloads directory, or wherever you saved it. Click on it, and click \"Open\"\r\n\r\n28. Click \"Next\"\r\n\r\n29. Click \"Finish\"\r\n\r\nNow simply wait. Your Ubuntu virtual machine will be loading up. This may take a few minutes. Don't worry if you see all kinds of strange messages/text. It is normal.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, you should start to see the Ubuntu desktop load. Unlike your firewall, you will notice that you do not have to click the mouse inside the window. It automatically happens. This is going to be much easier than the \"Firewall\" step.\r\n\r\nOnce everything has loaded, you will be looking at a window that says \"Install\" with a button that says \"Install Ubuntu\". If you cannot see everything, press RCTRL+F (to go full screen). You can return to windowed mode by RCTRL+F again. Any dialogs can be closed, and you can check the box that says \"Do not show me this again.\"\r\n\r\n30. Click \"Install Ubuntu\"\r\n\r\n31. Check \"Download updates while installing\"\r\n\r\n32. Check \"Install this third-party software\". Click \"Forward\"\r\n\r\n33. Ensure \"Erase and use entire disk\" is selected, and click \"Forward\". Remember, this is NOT talking about your hard disk. It is talking about the 8-10 gigabyte virtual disk.\r\n\r\n34. Click \"Install Now\"\r\n\r\n35. Now you will be guided through a series of installation related screens. The first screen asks you to select your timezone/time. Select your choice and click \"Forward\"\r\n\r\n36. Now keyboard layout, again select your choice and click Forward. If you are unsure, leave it as is or click \"Figure out keyboard layout\"\r\n\r\n37. \"Who are you?\" For \"Your name\" type in: mainuser\r\n\r\n38. When you type in \"mainuser\" the other boxes will fill in automatically. Now click in the text box next to \"Choose a password\".\r\n\r\n39. Do NOT use the same password as the firewall. Come up with a different password.\r\n\r\n40. Ensure that \"Require my password to log in\" as well as \"Encrypt my home folder\" are selected and checked and proceed.\r\n\r\nNow simply wait until the installation is finished. The installation may take a while, and it may appear to stall at some points. As long as the ubuntu mouse cursor shows an animation that is turning around in circles, the installation *is* working. Simply wait until it is done. If after an hour or two the progress bar hasn't moved at all, then go ahead and re-start the installation starting from step 24 (after closing the window and powering down the virtual machine). \r\n\r\nDepending on your computer, it could take 2-4 hours. Most likely, it will take about an hour. Once finished, you will see a dialog that says \"Installation Complete\" with a button that says \"Reboot Now\". Do NOT press the \"Reboot Now\" button. Close the 'X' on this window, and Power Down.\r\n\r\n41. Now, right click \"Primary\" and go to \"Settings\".\r\n\r\n42. Click on \"Storage\" in the left menu. Then click on the \"ubuntu-10.10... .iso\" under where it says \"IDE Controller\"\r\n\r\n43. To the right it says \"Attributes\" under that it says \"CD/DVD Drive : ...\" to the immediate right of that is a cd icon. Click it.\r\n\r\n44. Select \"Remove disk from virtual drive.\"\r\n\r\n45. Click \"Ok\"\r\n\r\n46. Now, making sure that \"Primary\" is highlighted, click the \"Start\" button at the top with the large green arrow.\r\n\r\nNow we wait for your newly installed Ubuntu machine to boot up.\r\n\r\n47. After a few minutes, you will see a dialog appear that says \"mainuser-VirtualBox\". Go ahead and click on \"mainuser\" which has the \"person icon\" to the left of it.\r\n\r\n48. Now it will prompt you for your password. Enter the password you used in the installation process.\r\n\r\n49. After a minute or so, you should hear a nice login sound, and you should be fully logged into your virtualmachine.\r\n\r\n50. Keep waiting, and a dialog will appear that says \"Information avialable\" and \"Record your encryption passphrase\" Click on: \"Run this action now\"\r\n\r\n51. Type in the same password you used to log in. After that window closes, click \"Close\" in the dialog box.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have now set up a virtual machine as well as a firewall to protect it. Now we need to finish configuring the primary virtual machine.\r\n \r\nNext:12. Ubuntu Initial Setup ===\r\n=== 12. Ubuntu Initial Setup ===\r\n\r\nOk, now that we have installed Ubuntu, we need to set it up so that we can use it fully. This also means making sure we can see flash on websites such as youtube. \r\n\r\n1. First, we have to install any updates that are pending. At the bottom of your screen, you should notice where it says \"Update Manager\". Click on that. \r\n\r\n2. Now, click on \"Install Updates\". If you did not see \"Update Manager\", then skip these two steps.\r\n\r\n3. Any time an administrative task is required, you will need to type in your password. This is the same password you used to log in.\r\n\r\nNow we wait, this is going to download any necessary security updates to make certain we are using the most current/secure setup possible. This may require downloading hundreds of megabytes. Just go ahead and let it do that, and when everything is downloaded and updated, proceed to the next step. While you wait, Ubuntu may go into screensaver mode. If so, just move the mouse and it will ask you for your password. That will leave screensaver mode.\r\n\r\nIf the updates are more than a hundred megabytes, it will take quite a while. It may take up to 2-3 hours depending on your computer and internet connection. Nonetheless, this step is critical. Do not skip the updates. Besides ensuring that your setup will be secure, the updates also ensure that all of the applications are up to date and thus most likely to function correctly. Just go ahead and watch a movie for a couple hours, and then return and check on it. \r\n\r\nAfter all of the updates have been downloaded and installed, the \"Update Manager\" window will now say \"Your system is up-to-date\" at the top. Further, it will say: \"The computer needs to restart to finish installing updates.\". Go ahead and press the 'X' in the top right corner of the window, and choose 'Send the shutdown signal\". If prompted, click \"Shut Down\". Once it has fully shut down, the window will disappear and you will be back at the VirtualBox manager. Go ahead and right click on \"Primary\" and click \"Start\". This will restart the virtual machine.\r\n\r\nIf a virtual machine fails to shutdown after 10 minutes or so, then go ahead and close the window again by pressing the 'X' but this time choose \"Power down\". If it still will not shut down, then VirtualBox may have crashed. If so, just follow these instructions:\r\n\r\n( Follow the steps in this mini-section if a virtual machine fails to shutdown, or you need to completely close/restart VirtualBox).\r\n\r\n( First, press \"Ctrl+Alt+Delete\", and then click \"Task Manager\"). Next, locate the process that is running that starts with \"VirtualBox\". Right click that process, and click \"End Process Tree\"\r\n(This should force the window to close).\r\n\r\n(Now, restart VirtualBox by going to your start menu, All Programs, Oracle VM VirtualBox VirtualBOx).\r\n\r\nNow you will have the VirtualBox manager up again. To restart the Ubuntu machine, simply right click on \"Primary\" and click \"Start\". \r\n\r\nOnce your Primary vm has rebooted, you will be again at the login screen. Here as before, click on \"mainuser\" and then enter in your password. Now your primary machine is fully up to date. Remember, be patient. It may take a few minutes before your virtual machine has fully booted. First you will see the background image and a mouse cursor that can move around, next you should hear the login sound play, and finally you will see the menu at the top and bottom of your virtual machine window. Depending on the speed of your computer, this may take 10 minutes or more. Just be patient. Don't worry if your virtual machine appears to be running too slow, we will speed it up.\r\n\r\nNow your Virtual Machine is set up and ready for use.\r\n\r\nNext:13. Installing Guest Additions ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 13. Installing Guest Additions ===\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that the Virtual Machine runs smoothly as possible, we are going to install some additional software to the virtual machine. \r\n\r\n1. Go to the \"Devices\" menu at the top of your virtual machine main window (Machine, Devices, Help), and go to \"Install Guest Additions\"\r\n\r\n2. Go to the \"Places\" menu at the top of your virtual machine (Applications, Places, System), and click on \"VBOXADDITIONS_4.0.4_70112\" (the number may be different).\r\n\r\n3. At the top this new window will be the text \"The media has been determined as \"UNIX software\". Click on \"Open Autorun Prompt\"\r\n\r\n4. A new dialog may appear saying \"This medium contains software intended to be automatically started. Would you like to run it?\" Click \"Run\"\r\n\r\n5. Enter your administrative password (the one you use to log into Ubuntu) and click \"Ok\"\r\n\r\n6. Now the VirtualBox Guest Additions installer will begin. This may take some time, so just relax and wait. Depending on your computer, this may take 30 minutes or more.\r\n\r\n7. When this is finished, you will see the text \"Press Return to close this window.\" Go ahead and do so.\r\n\r\n8. Once that window has closed, go ahead and press the 'X' to close the entire virtual machine window. Select \"Send the shutdown signal\" and click \"Ok\".\r\n\r\n9. A dialog box will appear. Click on \"Shut Down\", the top most option.\r\n\r\nAt this stage it is a good idea to further optimise our virtual machine. When you initially installed it, you most likely selected either 256 MB or 512 MB of RAM. If you have enough RAM to spare, then I highly recommend you increase that to at least 1 GB. Here is how to do so:\r\n\r\n1. First, right click on \"Primary, Powered off\" and go to Settings.\r\n\r\n2. Select \"System\" from the menu on the left.\r\n\r\n3. Increase the \"Base Memory\" to either 1024 MB (1 GB), or some higher value you are comfortable with.\r\n\r\nIt is also a good idea to increase the video memory available to the virtual machine. \r\n\r\n4. Select \"Display\" from the menu on the left, still inside of \"Settings\"\r\n\r\n5. Increase the \"Video Memory\" slider to the right as far as you are comfortable with. For example, 128 MB.\r\n\r\n6. Check the box \"Enable 3D Acceleration\".\r\n\r\n7. Now click \"Ok\" at the bottom.\r\n\r\nGo ahead and start up Ubuntu again by right clicking \"Primary, Powered off\" and clicking \"Start\"\r\n\r\nWhen Ubuntu loads up, go ahead and log in as before using your password. Now wait until Ubuntu is fully booted and the \"Applications Places System\" menu is visible.\r\n\r\nYou will probably notice that your virtual machine loads up and runs faster than before.\r\n\r\nHow well your virtual machine runs depends on how good your computer is. Primarily, RAM and processor speed are the most significant factors. If your computer is modern enough, you should be able to use websites with flash and even watch videos, such as on YouTube, with no problem. If your computer is not as modern, you will still be able to browse websites but may not be able to watch videos. You should still be able to use most flash based websites however.\r\n\r\n*** IMPORTANT: Do NOT browse sensitive content YET. At this stage, your virtual machine is not yet configured to use TOR. ***\r\n\r\nNext:14. Installing IRC (Optional) ===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== 14. Installing IRC (Optional) ===\r\n\r\n*** This section is entirely optional. If you are not interested in installing IRC, skip this section. ***\r\n\r\nTo install IRC on your new virtual machine, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the \"Applications\" menu, and go to \"Ubuntu Software Center\"\r\n\r\n2. Type \"kvirc\" in the search box field in the top right.\r\n\r\n3. When the results return, select the one called: \"KDE-based next generation IRC client\" or \"KV Irc\".\r\n\r\n4. Click \"Install\"\r\n\r\n5. Enter your password when prompted.\r\n\r\n6. While it installs, you will notice a progress bar. This may take a few minutes depending on the speed of your internet connection.\r\n\r\n7. Once it is finished installing, the progress bar will go away. Go ahead and close the \"Ubuntu Software",

    "body": "[url=https://www.cinavia.com/]Cinavia[/url] ([url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinavia]Wikipedia[/url]) copyright protection is a form of uncracked copyright digital rights management (DRM).\r\n\r\nCinavia affects a small number of home theatre playback devices of which the most commonly used is the Playstation 3. Cinavia is not detected in a DTS audio track when using the optical output.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]How Does Cinavia Work?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nCinavia works in two parts, an audio watermark and watermark detection capable hardware such as the Playstation or many newer Blu-ray players. The copy protection cannot work without both parts being present which is why certain films will not play while others will.\r\n\r\nThe audio watermark is part of the analog audio stream and is imperceptible to humans. This means that it survives being recorded on a microphone (such as CAM & Screener encodes) as well as surviving compression and re-encoding such as ripping a DVD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Examples[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[list=circle]\r\n[*] A movie copy made with a camcorder in a theater that contains Cinavia (THEATRICAL_NO_HOME_USE) watermark will stop playing within about 1 minute on a Playstation 3 and display a Message 1.\r\n\r\n[*] An unprotected (no AACS) Blu-ray backup of \u201cThe Losers\u201d (US release) will mute the audio after about 20 minutes with Message 3 (for not coming from a TRUSTED_SOURCE).\r\n\r\nThe developers of DVDFab have compiled a list of all films which contain Cinavia protection [url=https://blog.dvdfab.cn/cinavia-protection.html]here[/url].",

    "title": "A Guide to Uploading at TC",
    "body": "Planning your first upload to TehConnection? Or did you just notice in the [url=https://tehconnection.eu/log.php?search=]Log[/url], that our DoTs always edit your uploads and wonder why?  Well, get familiar with our [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=88]rules[/url], read through this step-by-step guide, and you'll be on your way to the [url=https://tehconnection.eu/top10.php?type=users&details=numul]Top 10[/url] before you know it!\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at the [url=https://tehconnection.eu/upload.php]upload page[/url]:\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/OIZtp.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]1. The \"Do Not Upload\" List[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis list shows the currently not allowed content. If it's on this list, do not upload it. Read it carefully and also keep in mind, that this list might be updated in the future. If you are unsure if your proposed upload is covered by this list check with staff FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]2. Your Personal Announce URL[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nEach member has an individual announce url, which is important to identify you, even if you seed from different IP's. Copy/Paste this url into your torrent client, if you create a new torrent. For further information on how to create a torrent, see [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=16]here[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]3. Torrent File[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nHere you have to place the torrent file. Make sure to check the \"Private Torrent\" box and also to include your personal tracker announce url, while creating the torrent. Again for further information see [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=16]here[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]4. Main Genre[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe best source to find the appropriate genre for a movie is [url=https://www.imdb.com]IMDb[/url], but keep in mind, that not always the first listed genre would be considered as the main genre. So read a synopsis of the movie first, if you're unsure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]5. Genres[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAdd all genres listed on IMDb here, including the previously chosen main genre. IMDb lists only up to 3 genres at the top, so scroll down below the actors to see, if there are more genres available. We also use a few genres different to IMDb, like Foreign for movies with the main language other than English or also Anime, Indie, Political or Stand-Up. You can add them and maybe other genres, which are appropriate, but not listed on IMDb, yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/vyIEi.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]6. The IMDb Number[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nHere you either have to place the IMDb ID, which you can see in the IMDb url, preceded by \"tt\" (e.g. 0118799) or the complete url. This is mandatory, since it's necessary for our site features to work properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]7. Fetch from IMDb[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAfter you have entered the IMDb number, fetch the data from IMDb. This will automatically fetch the Film Title, Year and also add a short synopsis to the Film Description. Be careful, if you add a new format to an already existing movie group, since fetching would overwrite the existing information in such a case.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]8. Torrent Without an IMDb Number[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis rarely happens. Almost all allowed content should have an IMDb ID. Only uncheck this, if you're absolutely sure, that this movie is not listed on IMDb. You can always PM a DoT or MOD or ask via Staff PM, if you can't find your movie on IMDb.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]9. Poster Image[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nHere you have to place the poster url. Never just copy/paste a link from another site like Wikipedia or IMDb for instance. Always rehost the poster to an imagehost, which allows hotlinking. Our recommendation: [url=www.imgur.com]Imgur[/url].\r\nThe Poster image must have a width greater than 238 pixels and the film poster should always be used instead of DVD covers. For foreign movies a poster in the original language is preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]10. Film Title[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe Film title gets auto fetched from IMDb, so usually you don't have to do anything here. One exception would apply to foreign movies, where you should add the original film title to the auto fetched English title like this: La vita \u00e8 bella (aka The Life is Beautiful).\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]11. Year[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAuto fetched from IMDb, so you don't have to change or add the original release date of the film yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/cLCHX.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]12. Format[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe Format drop down menu provides a list of allowed codecs/formats. If you're unsure which one to choose, read our wiki article about [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=122]CODECs & Containers[/url] or check the MediaInfo of your file. You can find a guide about how to use MediaInfo [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=69]here[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]13. Container[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe Container menu shows the allowed containers. For encodes choose the one which corresponds with the file extension of your movie (Matroska = MKV). For untouched sources choose the appropriate one. Again the wiki article about [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=122]CODECs & Containers[/url] might be helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]14. Resolution[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nHere you have to choose the resolution of your movie. Encodes very often include the resolution in their file or folder name, but you can also check the MediaInfo and compare the displayed resolution with our wiki article about [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=179]Video Resolutions[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]15. Source Media[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nFor untouched sources, well... choose the source. For encodes choose the original source, which is also very often provided in the file or folder name.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]16. Film Description[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis should provide a short synopsis of the movie. Usually our auto fetcher already places a shortened description from IMDb here, but you could replace this with a better one. We recommend to use [url=https://www.allmovie.com/]AllMovie[/url] as source, since they almost always provide a better and more comprehensive description than IMDb.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]17. MediaInfo Output[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nFor encodes it is mandatory to provide a full [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=69]MediaInfo[/url] output. You're allowed to delete the folder structure, which is displayed in \"Complete Name\", for privacy reasons. Just make sure, that at least for releases, where the file name differs from the folder name, the folder name is still included (e.g. Scene releases with cryptic names). Other than that, you're not allowed to alter the MediaInfo in any way. \r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]18. Release Description[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nHere you should place the NFO file, screenshots and additional information, which might be interesting, like added external subs, a comment by the encoder etc. Make sure you use spoiler tags for the NFO and screenshots for proper display. You can use an editor to prepare your description, but don't copy the NFO file into a txt document, since this would alter the file. So copy the NFO file directly into the upload form instead. For more information how to make a sexy release description check out [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=98]this guide[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/qwLE2.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]19. Special Edition[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nCheck this box for Special Editions, which differ from the original release. Do not check this box for a theatrical release.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]20. Year (of the Special Edition)[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis should provide the year, when the Special Edition was first released. As a side note: The release date for e.g. a Director's Cut might differ for DVD and Blu-Ray in some cases, although it's actually the same cut. That's just because they are not always first released in the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]21. Title (of the Special Edition)[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nHere you should place titles like Director's Cut, Extended, Uncut, Unrated, 3D etc. Special releases (e.g. Criterion Collection), which do not differ from the original cut, should only be noted here for untouched sources and never for encodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]22. Scene[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nCheck this box only for Scene releases. If you're not sure, if it's a Scene release, you can search for the group on our [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=147]wiki list[/url] and check one of the pre databases like [url=https://pre.corrupt-net.org/]pre.corrupt-net[/url] or [url=https://www.orlydb.com/]ORLYDB[/url] for instance. If you can't find your group/release in any of these, it's most likely not a Scene release.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]23. Scene (Additional Information)[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nHere you should place additional information related to the Scene release like Proper, Repack, Rerip etc. Usually you can see this information in the file or folder name of the release. Do not enter any information about a Special Edition (e.g. Director's Cut) here.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=4][b]24. Upload Torrent[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nEverything looks good and double-checked? Then now you actually just have to hit the upload button and seed for eternity! :D\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.: We all started somewhere, so if there are still questions, don't hesitate to PM a [url=https://tehconnection.eu/staff.php]DoT[/url] or ask via [url=https://tehconnection.eu/staffpm.php?action=new]Staff PM[/url] for assistance.",

    "body": "In order to connect to more than #TehConnection, you'll need an IRC client. [url=https://codeux.com/textual/]Textual[/url] is an OS X client which is very popular.\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Installing Textual[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAs with almost all OS X software, after downloading it add it to your [b]Applications[/b] folder to install it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Configuring Textual[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAfter installing Textual start it and you will see a window pop up. Click cancel at this initial window then click \"Add Server ...\" so we can configure your client before we connect.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/b1E07.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nConfigure the window that pops up as shown below. We recommend connecting with SSL but if you choose not to then uncheck the SSL box and change the port to 6667. Leave the password field blank.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/S5DrD.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nNext, select the Identity tab and fill the fields you see here. Nickname should generally be your site nick but does not necessarily need to be.\r\n\r\nAlternatives are for in case your nick is in use already. Usually an underscore is fine.\r\n\r\nNickServ Auth is a password to identify you as you to the IRC server. It is a password just for IRC and should under no circumstances be the same as your site password. The good news here is that you can set it and forget it as Textual will automatically send it to the IRC server every time you connect. Chose any password now and we'll configure it with NickServ later.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/o3Inf.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nAfter Identity select the Messages tab. Here you are able to give messages you would like Textual to relay to your IRC network(s) when you quit or if your PC goes to sleep.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/Be6eI.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nSelect the Autojoin tab next and click the plus symbol to add a new channel to automatically join.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/3wWMT.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nYou can see a list of channels available to you in your profile.

You can optionally disable highlights and join/part messages here too.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/phADy.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nNow select the Connect Commands tab and enter your connect command as described in the image. The text \"sitenick\" should be the nick you use on TehConnection and the text \"irc_key\" should be the IRC key set in your profile.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/T80oy.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nNow click Save to save your settings.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/QCcnr.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nRight click on the server and click Connect to have Textual connect to TehConnection and begin your chat session.\r\n[br /]\r\n[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/1HyhI.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor detailed IRC Network Information and channels available see [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=104]here[/url].",

    "body": "Your passkey is a unique identifier that is embedded in the url that your torrent client uses when it sends messages to the site. In this way you are identified (across ip addresses) and your upload and download counted. If other people know your passkey then they can spoof being you. This could result in your account getting associated with rule breaking. So you should not share your .torrent files  or your announce url.\r\n\r\nBut we are all human. Sometimes you paste your announce url in the wrong place, the reset passkey function is so that you can change your identifying info and stop any leaked url or torrent files from working or identifying with you. Unfortunately this means you have to change all the torrents in your client. Here is an easy way to do it in utorrent:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]\r\n[list=1]\r\n[*] Select all your tehconnection torrents.\r\n[*] Stop them all.\r\n[*] Reset your passkey by editing your profile.\r\n[*] Right click on the selected torrents in utorrentt, and select 'Properties'.\r\n[*] Remove the old tracker url and replace it with your new one (find it on the upload page).\r\n[/list]\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will work much the same way in deluge, transmission and the like. For rtorrent/rutorrent even with the edit torrent rutorrent plugin, this method will not (currently) work. Instead you can use [url=https://code.google.com/p/pyroscope/]pyroscope[/url] from the command line:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]\r\n[list=1]\r\n[*] Stop rtorrent\r\n[*] Make a backup of your *.torrent files (tar cvfz /tmp/metafiles.tgz ./.session ./watch or similar)\r\n[*] Reset your passkey by editing your profile.\r\n[*] chtor -a https://tehconnection..eu:2790/newpasskey/announce watch/*.torrent .session/*.torrent\r\n[*] Restart rtorrent\r\n[/list]\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will automatically only replace the url in tehconnection torrents.",

    "body": "[b]This guide will now work for 1080p and rental titles![/b]\r\n\r\nDiscuss this article here: https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=5390\r\n\r\nPastebin of the Requiem README: https://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Jm7GkTUV\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Software Needed[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n1. iTunes - To buy and download your Apple products (Versions 10.6.x and 10.7 with the newest Requiem)\r\n2. Requiem - To remove the Apple DRM\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent]Note: You may need the version of Requiem appropriate for when you downloaded your content, rather than the newest version.\r\n\r\n\r\nDropbox links for Requiem 4.1 (as Tor can be unreliable and slow) : [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/82224087/requiem-4.0.1-win.zip]Windows[/url], [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/82224087/requiem-4.0.1-mac.zip]OSX[/url], [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/82224087/requiem-4.0.1-src.zip\r\n]Source[/url][/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. [url=https://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en/Download]MediaInfo[/url] - It offers information about the video file\r\n4. [url=https://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html]MKVmerge[/url] - For remuxing the decrypted file and stripping it of your user information\r\n5. [url=https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp]Java[/url] - Java is java\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Working Method[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[b]1[/b]. Install iTunes and disable automatic updates. (When a new version of iTunes comes out, don't update until you check to see if Requiem is updated to support that new version)\r\n\r\n[b]2[/b]. Unzip Requiem on your HDD.\r\n\r\n[b]3[/b]. Install Java.\r\n\r\n[b]4[/b]. Buy, download your episodes and close iTunes. Requiem will not work with iTunes on.\r\n\r\n[b]5[/b]. Start Requiem and watch it work. It will automatically find DRMed files in your iTunes library and remove the DRM from them. The original DRMed files will be moved to the trash.  Make sure you verify that the songs and videos still work before emptying the trash.\r\n\r\nYou can also drag & drop files or directories (which will be searched recursively) onto the Requiem application or the Requiem window.\r\n\r\nStarting Requiem with the shift key down will disable scanning of the iTunes library. You can use this feature to start requiem with a blank window into which you can drag & drop files to be processed.\r\n\r\nNote: There is no progress bar so be patient. (You can check for .tmp files if you are unsure of progress.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]6[/b]. Install MediaInfo (or you can use the portable version). Open MediaInfo and load your decrypted *.m4v to see what audio tracks you have. If you are a more advanced user you don't need to do that, you'll recognize them in mkvmerge.\r\n\r\n[b]7[/b]. Install MKVmerge (or you can use the portable version).\r\n\r\n[b]8[/b]. Load your decrypted *.m4v file in MKVmerge, set the language for video and audio track, choose the destination folder and press \"Start muxing\". Remove AAC2.0 if it has both AC-3 DD5.1 and AAC2.0. If you are keen on keeping AAC2.0 too, at least move it to the second position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]Thanks to corleone on BTN for most of this guide![/i]",

    "body": "[center][color=red][b]This is a work in progress.  Please contact me on site or over IRC with suggestions or comments. --hwkns[/b][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]1. What You Will Need[/size][/b]\r\n[indent][list]\r\n[*]A nice TV with HDMI input, and a decent audio system (obviously).\r\n[*]A decent power supply (I recommend [url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151094]SeaSonic[/url]).\r\n[*]A low-end CPU.  Seriously.  You will not need a good one, I promise.\r\n[*]A motherboard that's compatible with your chosen CPU, and has enough SATA ports for all your drives.\r\n[*]A case that will fit your chosen motherboard, and will have enough 3.5\" drive bays to hold all your drives.\r\n[*]A decent amount of RAM (I went with 4GB because RAM is quite cheap, but you can definitely get away with 2GB)\r\n[*]A drive for your operating system (I recommend [url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227725]a solid state drive[/url] but any small drive will do just fine).\r\n[*]Data drives (as many as you can afford - these days a [url=https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Barracuda-3-5-Inch-Internal-ST3000DM001/dp/B005T3GRLY]3TB drive[/url] is pretty cost effective, but keep in mind if you're going to RAID your drives that more density isn't always what you want).\r\n[*]The [url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814134138]NVIDIA GT 440 GPU[/url] This beast will play anything you could ever download from TC.  My old setup would get maxed out and start stuttering and dropping frames during 1080p scenes with shoaling fish or flocking birds.  This GPU chews through those scenes with no problem and my low-end CPU stays at about 5% usage.\r\n[*]A CD, DVD, or USB stick to install Ubuntu from (the ISO is about 700 MB).\r\n[/list][/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]2. Getting started[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nFirst, assemble your components into a computer.  Then, [url=https://www.pendrivelinux.com/]make your Ubuntu pendrive[/url], boot from it, and install Ubuntu.  During installation, be sure to create a user account for yourself; using root because it's convenient is a bad idea.  If you don't have a static IP address, I would strongly suggest [url=https://free.domain.name/en.html]setting up a free dynamic DNS service[/url].\r\n\r\nInstall SSH so you'll be able to access your terminal remotely:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo apt-get install ssh[/quote]\r\n[color=red][b]WARNING:[/b][/color] Doing this allows your system to be compromised fairly easily.  If you don't want to get pwned, [url=https://www.wikihow.com/Use-SSH]learn to secure SSH access with keys instead of passwords[/url].[/indent]\r\n\r\nIn addition to using keys instead of passwords, you will want to lock down SSH access to only your user account and only a difficult-to-guess port number.  So edit your sshd_config file:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nChange the following lines (feel free to come up with your own random port number above 20000):\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][pre]Port 21376\r\nProtocol 2\r\nPermitRootLogin no\r\nX11Forwarding no[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nAnd add these lines to the end of the file:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][pre]UseDNS no\r\nAllowUsers <username>[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nOf course, replace <username> with your own username.  Hit Ctrl-O to save the file (and [ENTER] to confirm when prompted), then hit Ctrl-X to exit the editor.  Now restart the SSH daemon:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo service ssh reload[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nFrom here on out, you can run commands on your HTPC directly in its terminal window, or remotely via SSH from your laptop or any other computer.  Just log in with your credentials, and remember to use the correct port number for your connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]3. Installing necessary packages[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure your software is completely up to date:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nNow, make sure the following runs correctly:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2.2-common apache2-utils autoconf automake autotools-dev binutils build-essential bzip2 ca-certificates comerr-dev cpp dpkg-dev file g++ gawk gcc libapache2-mod-php5 libapache2-mod-scgi libapr1 libaprutil1 libc6-dev libcppunit-dev libcurl3 libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat1 libidn11 libidn11-dev libgssrpc4 libkrb5-dev libmagic1 libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libpcre3 libpq5 libsigc++-2.0-dev libsqlite0 libsqlite3-0 libssl-dev libsvn1 libtool libxml2 linux-libc-dev lynx m4 make mime-support ntp ntpdate openssl patch perl perl-modules php5 php5-cgi php5-cli php5-common php5-curl php5-dev php5-geoip php5-sqlite php5-xmlrpc pkg-config python-scgi screen sqlite ssl-cert subversion ucf unrar zlib1g-dev pkg-config unzip htop screen libwww-perl curl[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]4. Configuring Apache[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nConfigure the apache web server with some useful modules:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo a2enmod ssl; sudo a2enmod auth_digest; sudo a2enmod scgi[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nNow, to enable ruTorrent to function, we need to enable SCGI support in apache's conf file:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nAdd these lines to the end of the file:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][pre]SCGIMount /RPC2 127.0.0.1:5000\r\nservername localhost[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nHit Ctrl-O to save the file (and hit [ENTER] to confirm when prompted), then hit Ctrl-X to exit the editor.  Now reboot the server:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo reboot[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nAfter the reboot, you should be able to visit your server's IP address or domain name in a web browser and see Apache's generic \"It works!\" message.  Now, you don't want just anyone accessing this address, so you'll want to lock it down as well.  First, create an SSL certificate so you can access your server via https (You will be prompted for lots of information.  Leave all of it blank, except when it asks for your name -- give it the domain name instead):\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo openssl req $@ -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out /etc/apache2/apache.pem -keyout /etc/apache2/apache.pem\r\nsudo chmod 600 /etc/apache2/apache.pem[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nYour server now has a self-signed certificate that lasts for one year.  Next you will want to set up password protection:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo htdigest -c /etc/apache2/passwords gods <webusername>[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nReplace <webusername> with the username you would like to use to access the ruTorrent web UI.  You will be prompted for a password as well.  Feel free to use your system username and password for this, but realize that they are not linked in any way.\r\n\r\nNext, edit Apache's default sites-available file:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]cd /etc/apache2/sites-available\r\nsudo mv default default.old \r\nsudo nano default[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\n[color=white]==========work on this===========[/color]\r\nFor starters, paste in the contents of this pastebin: https://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=VZsCtLUg\r\nThis file simply contains [url=https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.html]Apache directives[/url] for your web server, so feel free to modify them to suit your own purposes.\r\n\r\nEdit /etc/apache2/ports.conf removing the conditional stuff at the bottom and changing 80 to 443.\r\n[color=white]==========work on this===========[/color]\r\n\r\nNow configure Apache for https, and reload the service:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo a2ensite default-ssl; sudo service apache2 reload[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nYou should now be able to see Apache's generic \"It works!\" message when visiting your domain or IP address in a web browser using [b]https[/b].\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]5. Installing Webmin[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nI like to use Webmin for convenient web-based remote administration of my servers.  To install it, first edit your apt sources file:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nAdd this line to the bottom of the file:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][pre]deb https://download.webmin.com/download/repository sarge contrib[/pre][/indent]\r\n\r\nHit Ctrl-O to save the file (and [ENTER] to confirm when prompted), then hit Ctrl-X to exit the editor.  Now fetch and install the PGP key for this new repository so we're not warned about it later, and then update and install webmin:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]wget https://www.webmin.com/jcameron-key.asc\r\nsudo apt-key add jcameron-key.asc\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install webmin[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nYou can test that it's working by visiting your server's domain or IP address in a web browser at port 10000 (e.g., https://myserver.com:10000 ).  We'll come back to this later to set up your firewall.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]6. Installing rtorrent[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nThere is an apt package for rtorrent, but it isn\u2019t compiled with xmlrpc-c, which we will need to use with ruTorrent.  So we're going to compile our own version of rtorrent with xmlrpc-c.\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]cd /tmp\r\nsvn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/xmlrpc-c/code/advanced/ xmlrpc-c\r\nwget https://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/downloads/libtorrent-0.13.2.tar.gz\r\nwget https://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/downloads/rtorrent-0.9.2.tar.gz\r\ntar -xvzf libtorrent-0.13.2.tar.gz\r\ntar -xvzf rtorrent-0.9.2.tar.gz\r\nrm *.tar.gz[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nNow configure and make xmlrpc-c, libtorrent, and rtorrent:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]cd xmlrpc-c\r\n./configure --disable-cplusplus\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n\r\ncd ../libtorrent-0.13.2\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n\r\ncd ../rtorrent-0.9.2\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure --with-xmlrpc-c\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n\r\nsudo ldconfig[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nOk, now we've got rtorrent installed, but it needs a config file to run, so create one:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo nano ~/.rtorrent.rc[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nFor starters, paste in the contents of this pastebin: https://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=FEB2KQf5\r\nYou will need to edit the paths for your own environment (especially if you don't want files downloading onto your tiny OS drive by default).  For further customization, you may find these documents helpful:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][url=https://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/rtorrent/rtorrent.1.html#AEN205].rtorrent.rc settings[/url]\r\n[url=https://fsk141.com/rtorrent-the-complete-guide]rtorrent - The complete guide[/url][/indent]\r\n\r\nWhen you are finished editing, hit Ctrl-O to save the file (and [ENTER] to confirm when prompted), then hit Ctrl-X to exit the editor.\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]WARNING:[/b][/color] [i]Make sure all the paths referenced in the .rtorrent.rc file actually exist, and that your user account has write permissions on them, or rtorrent will NOT run[/i].  Check your work:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]rtorrent[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nIf rtorrent starts up, you're good; you can quit by typing Ctrl-Q.  If you get an error instead, fix your .rtorrent.rc file before moving on.\r\n\r\nNow we will create a start-up script so rtorrent will run when your server boots up:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo nano /etc/init.d/rtorrent[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nPaste in the contents of this pastebin: https://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=kRr3utzw\r\nChange <username> on line 34 to your own username, hit Ctrl-O to save the file (and [ENTER] to confirm when prompted), then hit Ctrl-X to exit the editor.  Now set it to run on boot:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo chown root:root /etc/init.d/rtorrent\r\nsudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/rtorrent\r\ncd /etc/init.d\r\nsudo update-rc.d rtorrent defaults[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nIf you want to test it out, or start it without rebooting, use this:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]sudo /etc/init.d/rtorrent start[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nNow your rtorrent process should be running inside a screen session named \"rtorrent\".\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]7. Installing ruTorrent[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nruTorrent is really just a set of PHP and HTML files, so we're going to install them to a folder under our web server root.  Just grab the latest files from the subversion repository:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]cd /var/www\r\nsudo svn checkout https://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rutorrent[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nNext, download any [url=https://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/wiki/Plugins]ruTorrent plugins[/url] that interest you.  I recommend using the SVN option because it's easy to update everything when new versions are released.  After you finish with that, change ownership of all the ruTorrent files to the web server user, and change their permissions:\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][quote]cd /var/www\r\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data rutorrent\r\nsudo chmod -R 777 rutorrent[/quote][/indent]\r\n\r\nYou should now be able to visit your server's domain or IP address in a web browser with /rutorrent at the end (e.g., https://myserver.com/rutorrent ).  You will be prompted for the username and password we set up earlier in step 4 (Apache Configuration).  Once you have authenticated, you should see a working ruTorrent interface.  Congrats!  There's just one last thing to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]8. Configuring Your Firewall[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nAll that remains now is to lock down your server so that only the ports you need are open.  Webmin makes this easy, so go ahead and open it up in your web browser (e.g., https://myserver.com:10000 ).  Log in with your system username and password, and on the left hand navigation menu, go to Networking->Linux Firewall.  Under \"Incoming packets (INPUT)\", set the default action to [b]Drop[/b], and then add a new rule for each of the following:\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]WARNING:[/b][/color] The next steps are based on the example port numbers provided in this guide.  You are encouraged to change those port numbers, but don't forget to change the firewall rules along with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[indent][b]SSH (e.g., port 21376, found in /etc/ssh/sshd_config)[/b]\r\n[indent]Action: Accept\r\nNetwork protocol: Equals TCP\r\nDestination TCP or UDP port: Equals 21376[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]rtorrent TCP (e.g., ports 55995-56000, found in ~/.rtorrent.rc)[/b]\r\n[indent]Action: Accept\r\nNetwork protocol: Equals TCP\r\nDestination TCP or UDP port: Equals Port range 55995 to 56000[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]rtorrent UDP (e.g., ports 55995-56000, found in ~/.rtorrent.rc)[/b]\r\n[indent]Action: Accept\r\nNetwork protocol: Equals UDP\r\nDestination TCP or UDP port: Equals Port range 55995 to 56000[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]SSL (always port 443)[/b]\r\n[indent]Action: Accept\r\nNetwork protocol: Equals TCP\r\nDestination TCP or UDP port: Equals 443[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]Webmin (always port 10000)[/b]\r\n[indent]Action: Accept\r\nNetwork protocol: Equals TCP\r\nDestination TCP or UDP port: Equals 10000[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]Ping packets[/b]\r\n[indent]Action: Accept\r\nNetwork protocol: Equals ICMP[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]Local connections[/b]\r\n[indent]Action: Accept\r\nIncoming interface: Equals lo[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]Established connections[/b]\r\n[indent]Action: Accept\r\nConnection states: Equals ESTABLISHED,RELATED\r\n(Ctrl-click or click and drag to select both)[/indent][/indent]\r\n\r\nThat's it!  Be sure to double-check everything ([i]especially[/i] make sure you have allowed TCP connections over port 10000 so you can still access Webmin to fix any other mistakes), and then hit Apply Configuration.  Remember that you will need to add new rules for any additional services you want to run on any given port (e.g., XBMC's web interface).\r\n\r\nMaybe add stuff about installing XBMC, skins, add-ons, and the compiz issue: https://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=98108",

    "title": "uTorrent: Seed all your old downloads on a new computer or fresh OS install",
    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]1. Gather your .torrent files[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nMost trackers provide a place on your profile page to download all the .torrent files you've snatched in a single .zip archive.  Download this, and extract it to a folder somewhere.  For this tutorial, I'll assume you have extracted it to [color=white]C:\\Users\\noob\\Downloads\\torrents[/color] if you're a Windows user or [color=white]~/Downloads/torrents[/color] if you're a Mac/Linux user.  If you have multiple .zip archives from multiple trackers, you'll probably want to extract each one to a different folder, but for this tutorial I'll assume you only have one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Windows:[/b][/size]\r\n[indent]\r\n\r\nUsing Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder where you extracted the .zip archive.  You should see a bunch of folders in there, named by month and year (these are used to separate the torrents by when you snatched them).\r\n\r\nHold down the [Shift] key and right-click in the folder.  Then choose \"Open command window here\" from the context menu.  A command line will appear, and you will type into it:\r\n\r\n[pre]for /d %i in (*) do move \"%i\\*\" .[/pre]\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Mac/Linux:[/b][/size]\r\n[indent]\r\n\r\nOpen Terminal, and type:\r\n\r\n[pre]cd ~/Downloads/torrents\r\nmv */*.torrent .[/pre]\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\nNow you have successfully moved all the .torrent files into the same directory.  This will make it super easy to add them all to uTorrent.  You can close the command line / Terminal window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]2. Prevent ratio disaster[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]Disconnect your computer from the internet.[/b][/color]  I'm not kidding.  Turn off your WiFi antenna and make sure there's no ethernet cable in your computer.  If you add all these torrents at once and something goes wrong, [i]they will all start downloading and ruining your ratio faster than you can figure out what's happening[/i].  Disconnect your computer from the internet before you continue, and everything will be okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]3. Add torrents[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nOpen uTorrent, and go to Options, Preferences, Directories.  Check the box for \"Put new downloads in:\" and select the folder where all your data files are stored (not the .torrent files, but the movies, music, or whatever else you have collected).  If you don't have everything in one place, don't worry -- we'll fix that in the next section.\r\n\r\nNow check the box for \"Automatically load .torrents from:\" and select the folder where the .torrent files are (e.g., [color=white]~/Downloads/torrents[/color]).  Click OK and watch the magic happen!  uTorrent will add all the torrents for you and start hash checking them to see if the data is there.  When it finishes, you'll probably have some torrents that are still at 0%.  That brings us to the final step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]4. Clean up[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nFor each torrent that is stuck at 0%, find out if you have the data somewhere on your computer.\r\n\r\n[indent][list]\r\n[*] If you don't have the data and you want to re-download it, keep the torrent.  It will start downloading as soon as you connect to the Internet again.\r\n[*] If you don't have the data and you don't want to re-download it, remove the torrent.\r\n[*] If you do have the data on your computer, you'll need to point uTorrent in the right direction.  Keep reading.\r\n[/list][/indent]\r\n\r\nFor each torrent you're pointing to a new location, do the following.\r\n\r\n[indent][list]\r\n[*] Stop the torrent.\r\n[*] Open the Files tab of the panel at the bottom (if you don't see this panel, go to Options, Show Detailed Info).\r\n[*] Click on one of the files and type Ctrl-A (on Windows/Linux) or Command-A (on Mac).  This will highlight all the files.\r\n[*] Right click one of them and select \"Relocate...\" -- now browse to the folder on your computer where the data for this torrent is stored.\r\n[color=red]Note:[/color] If the torrent is for a single file, you'll need to browse to the folder that contains that file.  But if the torrent is for a [i]folder[/i] with file(s) in it (e.g., an album from What.CD), you'll need to browse to the folder that contains that folder.\r\n[*] Right click the torrent and select \"Force Re-Check\".  uTorrent will hash check the file, and if it says \"Finished\" you can start the torrent and it will seed.\r\n[color=red]Note:[/color] If it still says 0%, either you've given it the wrong location or the files there do not match that torrent.\r\n[/list][/indent]\r\n\r\nFinally, when you're okay with the idea that any torrents still at 0% will start downloading immediately, connect to the Internet!",

    "body": "Connection issues and torrent problems are common amongst users. As such, many threads tend to pop up about such topics. This thread was created to provide a common area to help diagnose and fix connection and torrent issues. Please read over this topic and search the thread before posting.\r\n\r\nTracker Status:\r\nWorking (Note this is updated if I'm around. But don't take this as 100% truthful,.)\r\n\r\nThings to Consider First:\r\nThere are a few common causes for many of the connection/torrent issues users experience. Before posting, please read them because chances are they explain your problem.\r\n\r\nIs the tracker working? If the tracker isn't working, well, then it isn't working. We most likely know about the issue and will inform you too. To fix this issue, check the IRC to make sure it's up and running normally If it's not, go watch a movie. You won't die, I promise.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you using a whitelisted torrent client? You won't be able to seed or leech if you are using a client that is not on the whitelist. If the tracker status says your client is not on the approved client whitelist, then you have this problem! It is commonly caused when you upgrade to a new version before it is approved. To fix this issue, choose an approved client or downgrade to a whitelisted version.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you using PeerBlock or similar software/IP lists? PeerBlock and similar programs give you a false sense of security. In the end they do nothing and block the tracker and good peers. If your torrents time out or are unable to reach the tracker, this may be your issue. To fix this issue, STOP using PeerBlock (seriously, it does nothing) or add an exception for PTP's tracker IP [91.217.90.42].\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you use Malwarebytes? Malwarebytes (pro version) recently began causing problems with PTP's tracker. Specifically, the tracker IP is being blocked by the website filtering. To fix this issue, you need to add PTP's tracker to the ignore list [91.217.90.42]. To do so, make sure website blocking and balloon notifications are enabled. Then visit please.passthepopcorn.me in your browser. A balloon should pop up through which you can add the tracker to the ignore list.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Not Those, Then What?:\r\nLook at the issues above and make sure you don't have them.\r\nFlush your DNS cache (While we're at it, switch to Google's DNS).\r\nRestarting computers saves lives.\r\nReset your network if possible.",

This behaviour is not common, but in order to prevent such abuse we have installed a hit and run detection script which enforces a minimum seed time for every torrent downloaded.  Obviously, we hope you'll seed for longer as that is what makes this place great and will assist you in increasing your member class.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]What Are the Minimum Requirements?[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nYou must seed each downloaded torrent for a minimum of 96 hours within two weeks of completing the download.",

You can read more about IVTC here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.doom9.org/ivtc-tut.htm\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions and edge cases, of course.  For example, some footage is shot digitally using the NTSC standard, so 29.970 is the proper frame rate.  Some documentaries use footage from various types of sources, so determining their proper frame rate is complicated.

Often, other trackers will not allow rar files to be uploaded.  If you find yourself in this situation; you can do the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nStop the active download in rtorrent, using these commands:\r\nControl + D\r\nControl + K\r\n\r\nMake a copy of the original directory:\r\n[pre]\r\ncp -R <original dir> <original dir>-copy\r\ncd <original dir>\r\n[/pre]\r\n\r\nUnrar the files within the original directory\r\n[pre]\r\nunrar e <name>.rar\r\n[/pre]\r\n\r\nCheck any sub-directories for rarred files and unrar as necessary\r\nDelete all rar files. Then delete the .sfv file. Delete any other unwanted files.\r\n\r\nThen, make the torrent file for the second tracker that you wish to upload to:\r\n\r\n[pre]\r\nmktorrent -p -a announce <original dir> -o output.torrent -l 19\r\n[/pre]\r\n\r\nOnce the newly created torrent has hashed, re-add the original files from <original dir>-copy using:\r\n[pre]\r\ncp -R <original dir>-copy/* <original dir>/\r\n[/pre]\r\n\r\nCheck all files are in place, then delete the copied directory like so:\r\n[pre]\r\nrm -rf <original dir>-copy\r\n[/pre]\r\n\r\nRestart the original torrent using:\r\nControl + S\r\n\r\nFinally, proceed with your upload on the non-scene tracker\r\n\r\nThere is likely a faster way of doing this, if so, your suggestions are welcome",

This makes communication much more efficient and will cut down on two or more of you snatching and uploading the same thing.\r\n\r\nYou have your own channel (#tc.uploaders) and more information on IRC can be found [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=104]here[/url].\r\n\r\nSince we trump based on quality, we'll have our DoT team and select encoders able to offer opinions on content you may be unsure of.\r\n[/list]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]Contribution[/b]: we're beginning the class out by requiring 25 uploads per month averaged over three months (so you can go on holiday or to war and not be kicked out straight away)\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a lot, but uploading seven torrents (a week's work) can easily be done in an hour or so. Obviously, you're going to pick your style of uploading and no one will be discriminated against for that. So whether it is better for you to upload one torrent a day or smash out 20+ in one sitting is up to you.\r\n\r\nWe're going to tweak the number on this if it proves to be unworkable for many but I'm pretty sure it will be OK.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]The Future[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nSome future features.

This is not in force yet and we'll let you know when it is.\r\n\r\nWe're also working on some tools which will help to centralise what is a fairly distributed job (multiple sites etc...) through an IRC channel and a potential tool on site.",

This may mean obtaining a BNC if you do not already have one. Setting one up on a seedbox/server is fairly straightforward and assistance with that can be gained from derekguy/GLaDOSDan. Try and check IRC at least once a day for any urgent messages or queries, obviously we're not going to be brutal about enforcing this but randomly disappearing for six months is not acceptable. Just flick an admin a quick PM if you're going to be away for a bit.\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]#TC.Support[/b]\r\n[indent]\r\nA corollary to IRC presence: all staffers must be present in the IRC support channel. It is mandatory to help out. We know it is boring re-enabling retards but someone has to do it. Also, that channel has been witness to some of the most epic lulz we have ever seen. Join for the comedic value at least. :wink:\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]Staff PM[/b]\r\n[indent]\r\nThe first point of contact for our members is the staff PM. Right now this feature is only available to the mods+ but in the future we'll have a proper ticket-like interface including the DoT team and assignable messages.\r\n\r\nWe try and aim for a fairly fast turnaround on messages here and for the most part they can all be answered in seconds. For anything you're unsure about ping another staff member for them to look at it.\r\n\r\nIf you're working on a PM click the link at the top of the interface to let others know it is being worked on.\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]Reports[/b]\r\n[indent]\r\nLook after any reports as soon as you are able. Feel free to ask for a second opinion on any reports you are unsure of. Even veterans come across weird stuff. If you have sent a PM mark the report as 'In Progress' so others don't send a PM too.\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\n[b]Torrents[/b]\r\n[indent]\r\nYou're an important moderator now but the entire staff team still helps out with torrent moderation. This is part of the moderation that is the most time consuming and helping out DoTs in IRC and acting on reports quickly is important.\r\n[/indent]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#4682b4]User Data[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nAs site staff we're entrusting you with the ability to perform user support in almost all capacities and this necessitates access to user information including IP and e-mail addresses.\r\n\r\nWe take the protection of our users' data [b]very[/b] seriously. Both the site code and staff conduct reflect this.\r\n\r\nYour responsibility as a staff member is to assist in the protection of that information. This means that no privileged discussion (IRC/forum) or user data should be disclosed outside TC staff circles.\r\n\r\nYou may, from time to time, be approached via IRC/site PM by users and other tracker staff requesting information about users on site.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances should you disclose this. Even if you're friends with them or think they are legit. We have strict information disclosure procedures and other tracker staff (especially) know that.\r\n\r\nIf you discover publicly available account information (passkey/username & password/account screenshots etc\u2026) in the first instance you should preserve the public data (links, screenshots, etc\u2026) then ensure the account is disabled. Note the links or screenshots in the staff notes for future use if/when the user visits our IRC support.\r\n\r\nViolation of our members' data in any way will be dealt with in the most severe manner possible.

Thank you for creating this!\r\n\r\nSo I am using transmission to download my torrents in and I am not sure how to get them to seed once they are downloaded. Before i joined Teh, the program I was using would automatically seed the torrents once they were finished but for some reason after they are finished downloading I get an exclamation mark next to the torrent and I am not able to get it to do anything. I am worried about ruining my ratio so if anyone can help me I would very much appreciate it! \r\n\r\nAlso, the first two movies I downloaded were very fast and now for some reason it is taking days to download movies. Not sure what is going on, would love input of that issue as well!\r\n\r\nThank you!",

    "title": "firztspawn - thoughts for TC",
    "body": "Things I would like to see implemented; either currently or in Black Swan (or any resurrection thereafter):\r\n\r\n[size=5] DoT's / Staff:[/size][list]\r\n[*] DoT's would benefit from the use of templates when pm-ing an uploader about an upload that is missing required info. There should be the ability to select from dropdows to choose the desired templated. The template would also be pre-filled in with the name of the torrent and the perma-link\r\n[*] Staff need to be seen to be more active  - whether its in IRC or the forums. IMHO if the staff are seen to do nothing; the site will do nothing.\r\n[*] Active participation by staff towards the encoder community within TC. Maybe promote TCO/HaB uploads every now and then on the front page\r\n[*] More front page usage/communication. i.e. once every 2 to 3 weeks. Be it rule changes, promoting TCO's\r\n[*] Maybe more community participation when looking at rule changes and clarity????? Not sure this is a good idea though.. but it will do something towards making staff appear more active and promoting more user/community participation. Or do something like this...[/list]\r\n\r\n[size=5] Uploader's / Archivist's:[/size][list][*] Upload templates - depending on your selection under \"Format\" would depend on the template bought up for the user to fill in\r\n[*] Archivists like gfadhriu should have auto access to #tc.uploaders IRC. It would benefit them as well as the site to know whats going to be [or is available to be] uploaded\r\n[*] In #tc.uploaders there needs to be a bot with the ability to scrape sites like SCC, HDBits, AwesomeHD etc. and then announce the movie uploads [b]ONLY[/b]\r\n[*] Archivists who have usenet etc. access should be actively sought after. These are the guys who will benefit the site greatly in regards to torrent retention. Somehow staff need to actively promote archiving to get more people in that userclass\r\n[*] Perks need to be sorted out for the new userclasses - Uploader and Archivist. Something like the ability to edit their own CT's; discounted SeedVPS seedboxes, the ability to customise their userclass, half-leech on any torrent on site (Archivist only) or limited number of half-leech per month, no taxes on requests. Some of these may already be available.. would have to check[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[*] Site should be able to grab full synopsis from imdb, not the partial it does now (ala MacGuffin).\r\ne.g. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2845578/\r\nCurrently the site will only grab:\r\n\"A war photographer who recently endured a brutal detainment in Libya holes up in Sicily to come to terms with her ordeal, not far from the home of her former lover and mentor. Soon she ...\". It should be able to search imdb for the full synopsis\r\n[*] \r\n[*] \r\n[*] \r\n[*] \r\n[*]",

    "title": "Installing ffmpeg on linux",
    "body": "[color=#4682b4][size=5][b]Installing ffmpeg[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nWe recommend always using the latest available build for FFmpeg to generate screenshots, as this will ensure the best possibile compatibility with the latest encoding standards and result in the most accurate screenshots.\r\n\r\n[indent][i][size=3]\r\nYou have three options. Install from a repository, install from a static binary or compile ffmpeg yourself. Installing from a repository will often result in you having a pretty old version of ffmpeg and so isn't recommended. Compiling ffmpeg yourself is slightly involved but if you want to there is [url=https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/UbuntuCompilationGuide]a guide for debian based distrobutions here[/url][/size][/i][/indent]\r\n\r\nThis guide will walk you through installing ffmpeg from a static binary someone else has compiled:\r\n\r\nGo to https://ffmpeg.gusari.org/static/\r\n\r\nChoose 32bit or 64bit depending on your system.\r\nCopy the URL of the latest build.\r\nRun the following but with your up to date url and file name:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]wget https://ffmpeg.gusari.org/static/32bit/ffmpeg.static.32bit.2013-10-01.tar.gz\r\n[*]tar -zxvf ffmpeg.static.32bit.2013-10-01.tar.gz\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nPut the binary somewhere smart. This will probably be in the /usr/bin/ directory, although we recommend putting it in  /home/<username>/bin and adding that directory to your [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)]$PATH[/url]. The reason for this is so you don't have to specify the path to the binary every time you want to use it. This is fine if you only use FFmpeg with this script, but is a bother if you use FFmpeg for anything else. Example: \r\n[list]\r\n[*]sudo mv ffmpeg /usr/bin\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nYou should now have ffmpeg installed.\r\n\r\nTest the whole setup: \"ffmpeg --help\". This should give you a basic help output. If you get \"could not execute binary file\", you probably have the wrong architecture for your system. If you get \"no ffmpeg in <blah>\" or \"ffmpeg: command not found\", then you haven't moved ffmpeg somewhere within your $PATH.\r\n\r\n[i](info provided by elwood & AmorphousDeception)[/i]",

On sites like imgbox and imagebam the default is 100x100 which is far too small. Below are some examples of sizes you should choose depending on the type of screens you're uploading.\r\n\r\n350 x 350 Keep aspect ratio -- this setting is good for solo screens\r\n250 x 250 Keep aspect ratio -- this setting is ideal for source vs. encode screens; where you want the screens to appear side by side\r\n150 x 150 Keep aspect ratio -- this setting is ideal for when you are comparing source vs. encode1 vs. encode2; where you want 3 screens to appear side by side\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, please fix the torrents mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need any help, please ask.\r\n\r\nThank you :)\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nI would suggest that if you decide to use these, personalise them a bit, maybe also change them slightly every so soften.\r\n\r\nHopefully v3. will have similar templates added :)\r\n\r\n[b]One for the moderators:[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote=Reported torrent]\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nwe have had a report on a torrent you are seeding:\r\n\r\ntorrent: [i]permalink here[/i]\r\n\r\nThis has been reported for \"[i]report reason[/i]\"\r\n\r\nHave you watched this movie?

    "body": "Hi there!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]HERE is the problem[/u]:[/b]\r\nSo, I have a SeedBox running ruTorrent v3.6 that is provisioned by WiCKED SERVICES...and I was attempting to generate some screenshots, BUT I ran into difficulties using their built-in screenshot option (which is provided by the Screenshots v3.60 plug-in).\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to create screenshots for a .mkv file (by right-clicking \"Create -> Screenshots\") VIA the \"File Manager\" tab:\r\n\r\nIn \"Console\" I would get...\r\n\r\nCommand log:\r\n\r\n--\r\nVideo screenshots creation started. Please wait this could take some time\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my \"Log\" I get...\r\n\r\n[02.08.2014 01:53:51] File Manager ERROR: undefined - 200 Current ffmpeg/ffprobe not supported. Please compile a newer version. SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character\r\n\r\n...ALSO I later got a slightly different Syntax Error message:\r\n[02.08.2014 14:02:25] File Manager ERROR: undefined - 200 Current ffmpeg/ffprobe not supported. Please compile a newer version. SyntaxError: Unexpected token C\r\n\r\n\r\n(...AND no screenshots are produced.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]HERE is my solution[/u]:[/b]\r\nWhile I suspect that some of the above issues with accessing this function VIA the \"File Manager\" tab resulted from some issue with my particular SeedBox host's installed version of ruTorrent v3.6, their tech support in this matter left me searching for my own answers.  Here is what I found...\r\n\r\n1) Instead of trying to access the \"Create -> Screenshots\" VIA the \"File Manager\" tab, FIRST select the completed torrent (in the MAIN ruTorrent window) and THEN access the \"Create -> Screenshots\" VIA the \"Files\" tab.\r\n\r\n2) The Screenshots interface is quite limited.  If you wish to configure any of the settings, click the blue sprocket \"Settings...\" icon (toward the top of the window) in ruTorrent, THEN click the \"Screenshots\" tab on the left-hand side.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Some additional resources[/u]:[/b]\r\nHere are some useful links (from ANOTHER SeedBox provider) incase you get lost along the way...\r\n\r\nhttps://wikidev.xirvik.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=tutorial_en_rutorrent#file_explorer_and_screenshot_plugin\r\n\r\nhttps://wikidev.xirvik.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=tutorial_en_rutorrent#screenshot_settings\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that helps! ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-A.S.",

And because I can, I have selected 2 encodes from the same movie group this month :D \r\n\r\nThese were both HaB encodes submitted by our own imdb.\r\n\r\nThis month's featured encodes can be found in the following group:\r\n\r\n\r\n[columns][center][size=6][url=https://jumpcut.to/something8916]Miracle on 34th Street (1947) - SD and 1080p - HaB[/url][/size]\r\n[url=https://jumpcut.to/something8916][img]https://i.imgur.com/E8WwQ.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n[b]Miracle on 34th Street (1947)[/b][/center]\r\n[i]At the Macy's Department Store Thanksgiving Day parade, the actor playing Santa is discovered to be drunk by a whiskered old man. Doris Walker, the no nonsense special events director, persuades the old man to take his place. The old man proves to be a sensation and is quickly recruited to be the store Santa at the main Macy's outlet. While he is successful, Ms. Walker learns that he calls himself Kris Kringle and he claims to be the actual Santa Claus. Despite reassurances by Kringle's doctor that he is harmless, Doris still has misgivings, especially when she has cynically trained herself, and especially her daughter, Susan, to reject all notions of belief and fantasy. And yet, people, especially Susan, begin to notice there is something special about Kris and his determination to advance the true spirit of Christmas amidst the rampant commercialism around him and succeeding in improbable ways. When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent psychologist erupts, Kris finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberates fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' friend, Fred Gaily, reassure Kris of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact Santa Claus. What ensues is a bizarre hearing in which people's beliefs are reexamined and put to the test, but even so, it's going to take a miracle for Kris to win.\t[/i]\r\n[/columns]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in learning to encode, or you think you have encodes which you believe fit the criteria for TCO, check out the following threads:\r\n\r\n[url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=5652]TC Original Encoding Support[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=619]DVD to x264 Guide (Windows[/url]\r\n[url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=3251]HD to x264 Encoding Guide (Windows)[/url]\r\n\r\nFor further encoding help, we also have an [url=https://tehconnection.eu/forums.php?action=viewforum&forumid=33]encoder's support forum[/url], as well as an IRC channel: #tc.encoders on our [url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=104]IRC network[/url].\r\n\r\nEnjoy <3",

    "body": "So, for now, this is just a \"quick-n-dirty\" little step-by-step Wiki (which I, or someone else MAY better illustrate at a later date)...\r\n\r\n1)  Find your desired movie title on [b][url=https://caps-a-holic.com]caps-a-holic.com[/url][/b] and choose two of the available sets of SOURCE screenshots.\r\n\r\n2)  Click the \"PNG\" button (top/middle area above the medium sized \"Preview\" screenshot) and THEN click \"Fullscreen Comparison\" (top/right).\r\n\r\n3)  Scroll down below the \"Preview\" screenshot until you come to your PNG formatted \"Fullscreen\" screenshot.  Prior to mouse-over one of your two selected sources will load, right-click the image and you should see an option to save the image.\r\n\r\n4)  Click the \"PNG\" button (top/middle area above the medium sized \"Preview\" screenshot) and THEN click \"Fullscreen Comparison\" (top/right).\r\n\r\n5)  Scroll down below the \"Preview\" screenshot until you come to your PNG formatted \"Fullscreen\" screenshot (prior to mouse-over one of your two selected sources will load, the other source will load when you mouse over).  Right-click the image and you should (hopefully) see an option in your browser to save the image locally to your HD.\r\n\r\n6)  Click the NEXT numbered comparison frame (just above the \"Preview\" screenshot) and repeat steps 2-5 (above).\r\n\r\n7)  Once you have saved ALL of your desired PNG formatted \"Fullscreen\" screenshots locally on your HD for one set of sources (I would recommend the use of simple/strategic filenames for organization), THEN go back and reverse the two previously selected sources (in step 1) so that the other source will load on mouseover (in step 5).\r\n\r\n8)  Double check that everything appears to be in good working order, THEN upload to your SOURCE vs. SOURCE comparison set to your preferred screenshot host (for a touch of class, I would suggest \"citing\" your source as being caps-a-holic.com in your screenshots description).\r\n\r\n9)  Use the \"Screenshots\" section of our [b][url=https://tehconnection.eu/wiki.php?action=article&id=98]Release Description Guide[/url][/b] to properly format and label your SOURCE vs. SOURCE tags.\r\n\r\nAll the best! ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n-A.S.\r\n\r\np.s.  Here's a good/solid example of how this could and should look in it's final form, here on TC...\r\nhttps://jumpcut.to/something320&torrentid=29248",
